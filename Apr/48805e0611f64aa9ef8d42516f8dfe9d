The Briton had hinted after the sixth-round knockout of Dillian Whyte that he would leave the sport. Speaking on a British television show, Fury has now confirmed that he is done with boxing and is looking to spend more time with his family. The 33-year-old is unbeaten in 33 bouts. If he goes ahead with retirement, he will miss out on an opportunity to fight for the undisputed crown.
