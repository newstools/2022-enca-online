At least 93 countries voted in favour, while 24 opposed it. South Africa and 57 other countries abstained. Pandor said, "we are clear that we adopt and independent view on how we vote. We cannot be directed by anyone as to how we should vote on behalf of South Africa." "We have said that we believe the aggressive discourse, the name calling and use of the General Assembly for passing resolutions that add further criticism doesn't add to the resolution of the problem. It's not assisting, it is expanding the range of hate and conflict that we are observing from afar."
