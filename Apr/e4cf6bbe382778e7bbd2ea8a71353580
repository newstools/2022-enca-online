Mabhongo said, "South Africa is of the firm belief that the tabling of the resolution that we will consider today [Thursday] is premature and pre-judges the decision of the commission of Inquiry." "We must allow the commission to undertake its mandate and report to the Human Rights Council on its outcomes. The resolution will further divide the matter and the general assembly itself." "South Africa maintains that in considering the suspension of a member we must be consistence and not be selective. For these reasons South Africa will abstain on the resolution, thank you Mr President.”
