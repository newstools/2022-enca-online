Mbalula says more than half the motorists, whose licenses expired during the height of the pandemic, have still not applied to renew them. He adds that the department has managed to reduce the backlog to 1.4-million. Mbalula announced a final extension to the grace period yesterday. Motorists now have until 15 April to renew their licences.
