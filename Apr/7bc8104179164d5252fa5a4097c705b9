Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter. JOHANNESBURG - Stuart Baxter’s second term as Kaizer Chiefs coach has officially ended after the Englishman received his marching orders on Thursday. It seems the club has finally heeded the supporter's calls to axe Baxter. According to a statement by the Soweto side, coaches Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard will take over as caretaker coaches for the remainder of the season. READ: Baxter's replacement sought It was thought that the 68-year-old would revive the club’s fortunes after taking over from Gavin Hunt. But the arrival of Baxter, who was parachuted into the bench for the CAF Champions League final last season, has bought more misery for the Amakhosi faithful. The club has seemingly given up on their league ambitions this season following a shock 1-0 defeat to SuperSport United, which was the final straw.
