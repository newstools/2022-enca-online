President Cyril Ramaphosa is addressing the nation tonight at 8pm. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the termination of the national state of disaster on Monday. Ramaphosa addressed South Africans on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. "While the virus continues to circulate, it is not causing the same levels of severe illness that requires hospitalisation or the same number of deaths. While the pandemic is not over and while the virus remains among us these conditions no longer require that we remain in a national state of disaster," he said.
