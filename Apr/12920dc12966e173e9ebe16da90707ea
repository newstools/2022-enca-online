Coach Jacques Nienaber and his management team will gather troops in a two day camp in Durban from 10 April then move to Cape Town from 1-5 May. A selected group of players from around the country has been invited to the camps. They will appear in both cities as the Boks gear up for their exciting season. More players, could be invited to the second camp. The camps will be to expose the players to the plans for the season and the Springbok culture as they look ahead to the Castle lager Incoming Series in July. They face Wales in three back-to-back Tests, and then the Castle Lager Rugby Championship in August and September.
