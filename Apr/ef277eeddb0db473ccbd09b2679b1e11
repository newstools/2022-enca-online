The North West Health MEC says he was not aware of the incident and is awaiting a report on the reasons behind the act. READ: Shots fired at protesting Witrand Hospital staff North West Health MEC Madoda Sambatha said, "I am here for a meeting the reason for the meeting is because there is this agreement between management and NEHAWU on PMDS we wait here for the meeting to start workers who were coming here who had a confrontation with the police." "I was not on the side where the police were, I do not know the reasons and I will not allow a situation where you turn a hospital a confrontation zone." "There is two things that are wrong, one: it is wrong to burn tyres inside the hospital. Two, it is wrong for workers to be chased by police but that component of police I do not know." "I'll get a report later as to what was the reason for police to end up shooting at workers.”
