 JOHANNESBURG - Abafana Ababi is a brand new locally produced action comedy starring Thomas Gumede as Thebe, a comical cool cat, Matli Mohapeloa as Gift, a slick ladies’ man and Justin Strydom as Stuard Rembrand, the crime boss. Thebe and Gift are best friends from Orlando, Soweto, who grew up poor with aspirations of being rich. They take the easy road and get into a life of crime, and make it big as two bandits modelled on Robin Hood – stealing from the wealthy (who acquired their money from dirty deals in the first place), and then share their takings with the community. About the Cast Thebe Nzima (Thomas Gumede) grew up in an orphanage and believes that greatness is not birthed, but is self-made. He is restless and always on the go.  He lives fast and plays hard … and enjoys the thrill of it. He would never let himself be tangled in romantic, intimate relationships. Thebe enjoys the life that crime has afforded him and now relies on it to fuel his lifestyle. After Gift Molefe (Matli Mohapeoa) landed up at an orphanage, the matron, Gogo (Lilian Dube) raised him like her own and she’s the closest thing to a mother that he has. Not wanting to settle for a life of poverty, and feeling disillusioned by the system, Gift went into a life of crime for profit … and uses what he earns to give back to the orphanage that raised him as well as the community that shaped him.  Abafana Ababi will stream from 19 April, exclusively on eVOD and promises to entertain from start to finish.
