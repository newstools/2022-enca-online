"I think he's seen it in one of the, on the news, then he take that advantage to come here and check what we've agreed with the community. So this is what I call him a hijacker because from yesterday [Tuesday] he was not here, from today [Wednesday] in the morning he was not here. He came today after he's seen on the news. He wanted to hijack, to be popular with this thing." "This thing is for community, not for anyone. So he hijacked what the people of Diepsloot are fighting for.
