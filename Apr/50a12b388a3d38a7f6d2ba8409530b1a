The Provincial Working Task Team met on Tuesday and said there are disputes that still need to be resolved. They will be dealt with by the National Dispute Resolution Committee. A new date for the conference will be announced. The conference is likely to see a battle for chairmanship between Premier Oscar Mabuyane and Public Works MEC Babalo Madikizela.
