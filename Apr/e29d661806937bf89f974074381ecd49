Third hundred in three county games - India's Cheteshwar Pujara MUMBAI - India Test batsman Cheteshwar Pujara compiled his third century in as many matches for Sussex to give the south coast club control of their English County Championship match at home to Durham on Friday. Pujara, who missed Sussex's opening fixture of the season against Nottinghamshire, had already made up for lost time with scores of 201 not out and 109 away to Derbyshire and Worcestershire respectively. But Friday's match was his home debut for Sussex at the Second Division side's Hove headquarters. The 34-year-old, a veteran of 95 Tests for India, made an unbeaten 128 in a total of 362 for five in reply to Durham's first innings 223 to help give Sussex a lead of 139 runs come stumps on the second day of four. He had faced 198 balls with 16 fours, when bad light halted play with 13 overs remaining. But for all Pujara's runs already this season, an injury-hit Sussex have endured a tough start to their Championship campaign, with two of their first three matches ending in defeat by 10 wickets and an innings.
