File: Eskom has cut off electricity to municipalities that owe them billions. JOHANNESBURG - Power cuts will be downgraded to stage 3 from 10pm tonight. Eskom says six generating units have returned to service over the past 24 hours. More units are expected to be back tomorrow. Stage 3 will be in place until Friday morning. But this could change at any time, depending on breakdowns. Eskom implemented Stage 4 blackouts on Tuesday morning after units at Majuba and Tutuka power stations tripped.
