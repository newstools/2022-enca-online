READ: Senzo Meyiwa murder-accused return to court Nel says Meyiwa's family is unable to attend today's proceedings but will be in court next week. He said, "the fact that they are not here indicates to you that it’s been a stop-start affair, and they have to travel long distances to be here, they want to be here. They are relieved that we will start so let us monitor it and certainly if the trial started they will be here, they’ll support it. It's their opportunity to get justice, to get closure."
