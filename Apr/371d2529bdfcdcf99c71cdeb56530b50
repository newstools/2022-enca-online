"Bad Guys," a sort of animal-eye version of "Oceans 11," follows the exploits of a wickedly clever gang of creatures. Produced by DreamWorks Animation, the film has a voice cast including Sam Rockwell, Craig Robinson, Awkwafina, Marc Ramon, Anthony Ramos and Lilly Singh. Overall, this was a good weekend for family-geared films -- hit harder by the Covid effect than films targeting other demographics -- with Paramount's "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" again placing second, at $15.2-million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. "Family moviegoing was certainly rocked by the pandemic, but families are returning now," said David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. "We're still far from pre-pandemic levels... but this is a good start." Third spot went to "Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore" from Warner Bros., at $14-million, a fairly sharp drop from last weekend's $43-million opening for the Wizarding World film. New releases claimed the next two spots. "The Northman" from Focus Features took in $12-million. It tells the blood-soaked story of a Viking (played by a ripped Alexander Skarsgard) who seeks revenge on the man who killed his parents and usurped his father's throne. Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke, Bjork, Anya Taylor-Joy and Willem Dafoe round out the ensemble cast. And in fifth was Lionsgate's very meta film "The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent," at $7.2-million. Nicolas Cage plays, none too seriously, a man named Nick Cage.
