For a few days in the year, cricketers from the SANDF, SAPS and the Department of Correctional Services kit out in their respective colours for the SA Forces Week. At the end of the week, players from this CSA-affiliated tournament are awarded national colours at this level. POTCHEFSTROOM - When they’re not dressed in their regular uniforms, some members of the security cluster kit out for a different kind of national duty. At least 120 employees from three departments within the cluster took part in the SA Forces Cricket Week. The first since 2019. It’s an annual tournament that helps players break away from the demands of a stressful environment. At the end of the week, players from this CSA-affiliated tournament are awarded national colours at this level. Organisers hope that the global expansion of the game will benefit their tournament. * eNCA's Hloni Mtimkulu reports.
