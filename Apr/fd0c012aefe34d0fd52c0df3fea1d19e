File: Former President Jacob Zuma. AFP/Phill Magakoe JOHANNESBURG - The JG Zuma Foundation says the recent ruling by the Supreme court of Appeals is unclear and to proceed with a criminal trial against the former president would be a travesty of justice. The appeals court dismissed Jacob Zuma's leave to appeal his corruption prosecution. This included his attempt to remove State advocate Billy Downer from the trial.

Zuma's corruption trial is due to start on 11 April. He and French arms company Thales face several charges of corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering linked to the multi-billion rand arms deal.
