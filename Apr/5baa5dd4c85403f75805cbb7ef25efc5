One man, however, got social media buzzing over his freeway trolley dash. A man was filmed riding in a shopping trolley while holding on to the back of a petrol tanker on the freeway. Videos posted on social media show him smiling and waving to onlookers as he heads toward Johannesburg on the N1 highway.     It's unclear how fast the truck was driving or whether the driver was aware of his would-be passenger. The number plate of the truck is visible as well as signs on the road, but it is unclear when the footage was recorded. Gauteng traffic police say they will investigate the footage. At the same time, social media users were amazed that the unbranded trolley could maintain such high speeds.
