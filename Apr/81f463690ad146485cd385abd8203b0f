AFP/Ander Gillenea BARCELONA - Barcelona returned to winning ways on Thursday night, registering a slender win over Real Sociedad and moving to second on the table. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s only goal was the difference on the night. It is his ninth goal in eleven La Liga appearances, as he guided the Catalans to victory. The win lifts Barca into the second spot with 63 points, 15 behind runaway leaders Real Madrid. Sociedad will remain sixth on the table, with just six points off a Champions League spot, with five games left. The Los Blancos of Madrid need only four points from their last five games to secure a 35th La Liga title.
