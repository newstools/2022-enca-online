"Only yesterday [Monday], the announcement of the new head of department [was made]. The new person is coming in and facing a potential crisis. There hasn't been a permanent appointment of a chief financial officer either and there's other senior posts in which there are acting personnel as well. "That is not a good sign for this department which is notorious for scandals over the years." Bloom says many hospital in Gauteng are understaffed and underequipped.
