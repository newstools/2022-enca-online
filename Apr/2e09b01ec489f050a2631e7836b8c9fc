Not only what you saw in terms of copper. It was a big bust on the drugs, more than 1,000 Mandrax and other kinds of things. "So this team will be concentrated on chasing these economic crimes. But not only that, give them the power for intelligence, for investigation because it's not just the people that are taking this copper, are the people that are inside the sites of construction," Cele said.

"These things are not known by all of us, by people in the township. "But some people, they go in the bush, which means somebody gives them the map and all that. It's a big syndicate of which we are going to be responding exactly that way to say it's not just an ordinary criminal, it's a high syndicate and as such we will respond."
