American Shaine Casas checks the scoreboard after winning the men's 200m individual medley at the San Antonio Pro Swim SAN ANTONIO - American Shaine Casas won the men's 200m individual medley at the San Antonio Pro Swim on Saturday with a world-leading time and personal best of 1min 56.70sec. Thanks to his strong butterfly and backstroke legs, Casas led compatriot Michael Andrew by almost a second at the halfway stage, and he held on over the breaststroke and freestyle legs to beat Leon Marchand, whose runner-up time of 1:56.95 was a French national record. Chase Kalisz, who won Olympic gold in the 400m medley in Tokyo last year, was third in 1:57.10. "I had a feeling that Leon was coming back," Casas said of the 19-year-old rising French star, who is training at Arizona State University under US great Michael Phelps's longtime mentor Bob Bowman. "Everybody was so close. I went out -- I went for it, and that is kind of how I like to swim that race. "It was a best time, so I can’t be mad with that. Definitely will give me some things to think about." The race gave a tantalizing glimpse of what the event could offer at the US trials for the 2022 World Championships, which will be held in Budapest June 18-July 3. Marchand, meanwhile, punched his third World Championships ticket, after qualifying with his performances in San Antonio in the 400m individual medley and the 200m breaststroke.
