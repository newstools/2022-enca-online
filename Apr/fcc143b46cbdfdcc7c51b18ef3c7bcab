Not everyone is on board and willing to work together to end crime in Diepsloot. A WhatsApp message circulating on social media hints at how volatile the situation currently is. It comes after the suspected vigilante killing of a Zimbabwean national identified as Elvis Nyathi. eNCA's Nqobile Madlala reports. Courtesy #DStv403 SOWETO - Diepsloot community leader Lefa Nkala says the increased police presence and capacity following last week’s protests comes as a relief. He says the three-month deployment may not be enough to resolve the crime-ridden area.

"At least they are bringing some order… It’s very sad to lose any family member in such a manner. As much as we are feeling sad about Elvis, the same feeling must go to people who have lost family members." "Over the weekend there were funerals in which some of these people were buried. We want to bring these killings to an end." "We’ve got foreigners in Diepsloot who have come legally and there are those who came illegally and opted to be criminals. The minister told us these police will be here for three months of which is not enough." "We will be following them and check if the situation has changed after those three months. The minister promised the same thing in 2020 and immediately thereafter life went back to an even worse situation."
