eNCA Ayesha Ismail has more details. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Zandile Mafe, the man who stands accused of setting Parliament on fire, will have to wait a little longer to find out if he will be granted bail. Mafe was denied bail in the Cape Town Regional court last month and is now appealing to the High Court to let him out. READ: Parliament Fire | Mafe challenges bail refusal Mafe made several court appearances in the lower courts charged with arson, terrorism and housebreaking and theft. He was also sent to Valkenburg Hospital after the state presented a document from a medical doctor stating that Mafe suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. His lawyers still maintain there is nothing wrong with him. READ: Alleged Parliament arsonist Zandile Mafe denied bail They say the magistrate made a wrong decision in denying Mafe bail. Judges James Lekhuleni and Daniel Thulare have reserved judgment. * eNCA's Ayesha Ismail reports.
