The SA tennis ace got the better of Roberto Carballes Baena in 3 sets in a match that lasted an hour and 58 minutes. The world number 40 sent down nine aces compared to the Spaniards one in a close match. Harris will be hoping for a better display in the Spanish city after suffering a first-round defeat at the Montecarlo Masters last week. His 6-4 and 7-6 see him face another home favourite Albert Ramos-Vinolas.
