However, she's expressed concern that her client is being prejudiced. READ: Khumalo's lawyer speaks after being asked to leave court "The state is uncertain as to whether my client is a witness or not, and this is something that is so perplexing because my client was present, she was attacked and there is evidence which will confirm that indeed there was an attack on her and there was a robbery," Moonsamy said. "So the state's uncertainty whether my client will be called or not makes the recusal somewhat nefarious because she remains a victim. "My client has been cooperating, has been compliant with all the requests that have been made by the state, by SAPS so she's waiting for her day to find closure as well... I don't see how they can be prejudiced against a victim."
