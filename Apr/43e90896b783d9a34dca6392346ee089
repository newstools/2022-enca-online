JOHANNESBURG – It’s wedding season on Durban Gen and your favourite nurse Sne has snatched the man of her dreams, in a star-studded double-episode wedding special from the 14th – 15th of April. On the big day, Dr Dhlomo (Nyaniso Dzedze) arranged for him and his fiancée to be driven to the wedding venue together in a luxury vehicle. But Sne changes her mind and arrives at the event before him, leaving a sour taste in the doctor’s mouth and resulting in him doing the unimaginable. It’s a glamorous event filled with the biggest stars including Nkanyiso Bhengu playing the priest officiating the wedding. Sne’s parents will be played by Delisile Malinga and Magic Hlatshwayo. And, lookout for a special guest performance by Vusi Nova!
