READ: Patriotic Alliance promises to write off municipal debt His party has bagged its second mayoral chain with McKenzie's election, uncontested, to the post in Beaufort West. This is thanks to coalition partners, including the ANC. The firebrand has made several bold promises to residents in his acceptance address, such as eradicating bucket toilets and opening derelict swimming pools within his first 100 days in office. McKenzie said, “there are people who harbour hopes that this coalition between the KDF, PA, and the ANC won’t last. I came today with good news for the patriots. This coalition will last five years.” With the support of Truman Prince, a well-known former mayor whose wife is McKenzie’s deputy, the district’s new leader says he will be a mayor for all. He’s promised to clean house, and make widespread changes to the towns of Beaufort West, Laingsburg and Prince Albert within the next three months. He said, “the first promise I make here today, is between 7 and 14 days a tender will be issued to fix all the bucket toilets. There’s no way I want to be the district mayor of people who still use the bucket.” But he's also made his party’s anti-foreigner sentiment clear, saying he will personally check on the status of businesses in the towns. McKenzie also says he will see to it that council workers who play politics, and don’t turn up for work, lose their jobs.
