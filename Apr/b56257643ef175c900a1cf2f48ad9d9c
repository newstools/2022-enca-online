Neeshan Balton, executive director at the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, chats to #eNCA about this. #DStv403 DURBAN - With purses across the country being opened for disaster relief in KwaZulu-Natal, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says oversight is needed to ensure funds are not stolen. The foundation says lessons must be learnt from the corruption that took place with public funds needed for COVID-19 relief, and make sure it's not repeated with flood relief funds. It also says transparency about what exactly the funds will be used for is required.
