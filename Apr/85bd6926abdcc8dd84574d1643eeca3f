Some motorists have been unable to renew their expired driving licence cards despite the extended grace period. There has been a backlog with the outstanding licence cards, which expired between November 2021 and January 2022. Wayne Duvenage CEO of OUTA speaks to #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - There is growing pressure to increase the validity of driver's licence cards from five to 10 years. Outa's Wayne Duvenage says the move could help deal with the current backlog. READ: Deadline to renew driving licences extended Many motorists are struggling to renew their driving licences. "Many countries around the world, especially in Asia, have a ten-year validity. We don't see why they haven't gone that route," Duvenage said. READ: Mbalula concerned over slow driver's licence renewal process "In 2013, Transport Minister Dipuo Peters had already agreed and gazetted the driver's licence validity to 10 years. "That would mean they went back on that decision that would be the easiest way to resolve this problem. It doesn't help that they haven't fixed the online booking system. If they get the online booking system right there should be no reason why they can't do that. Getting an online validity problem fixes that."
