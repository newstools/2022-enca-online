She visited the area on Saturday following a week of anti-crime protests. It is believed the protests were prompted by the killing of some South Africans. One foreign national was killed in an alleged vigilante attack. WATCH | Phalatse meets police leadership in Diepsloot Phalatse says the city has plans to improve the area. "In terms of interventions, when you tackle crime, you deal with crime but you also deal with the causes of crime," she said. It is no use deploying police into the area if there are socioeconomic issues that you are not addressing or structural issues and that is why I spoke about issues of housing."
