  JOHANNESBURG - The bodies of three children have been recovered from a river in Diepsloot. The boys aged between 8 and 10 are believed to have drowned on Monday. The circumstances surrounding the drowning are being investigated. Officials are urging parents to keep an eye on young children and keep them away from streams. They say children will be tempted to play next to rivers as water levels rise after the weekend's heavy rainfall.
