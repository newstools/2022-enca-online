File: A gold mine. AFP/Rodger Bosch JOHANNESBURG - Thousands of striking workers at mining giant Sibanye-Stillwater are standing their ground after refusing the company's latest wage offer. Sibanye increased its offer to the lowest-paid workers from R700 to R800 per month for three years, and also added a R50 increase to its living out allowance. READ: Unions meet Sibanye on latest wage offer The strike is in its seventh week and unions AMCU and NUM say they are prepared to make more sacrifices for R1,000 increase. Sibanye's no work, no pay policy means workers have lost almost a billion rand in wages. AMCU has taken aim at CEO Neal Froneman's salary.
