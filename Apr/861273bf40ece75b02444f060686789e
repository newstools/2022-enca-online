The government wants to make it mandatory for all metal traders to have licenses in a bid to combat the massive theft of rail, power, and telecommunication lines. Evert Swanepoel from the Copper Development Association Africa discussed this with eNCA's Gareth Edwards. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Giving licences to metal traders will not end the massive theft of rail, power and telecommunication lines. This according to Evert Swanepoel from the Copper Development Association Africa. Government is planning to make it mandatory for scrapyards to have licences, in a bid to stop cable and metal theft. EXCLUSIVE: Cable theft 'an inside job', says Prasa chairperson "The licencing will not do any different of what happening at the moment. The bypassing of the system and the export of scraps will continue," Swanepoel said. "The licence will possibly be ignored. It is a very huge industry and I think policing it is difficult... introducing the licence won't do any harm but I cannot see officials policing licences effectively."
