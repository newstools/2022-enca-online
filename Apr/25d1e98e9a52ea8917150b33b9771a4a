 SPONSORED - African Development Bank Group President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina has said that the most important lesson of the Covid-19 pandemic for Africa is the need to build a defense mechanism against external shocks, especially in healthcare and financial security. “Investing in health is investing in national security,” Adesina told African leaders the opening of the 35th African Union Assembly in Addis Ababa, in February. “Africa cannot afford to outsource the healthcare security of its 1.4 billion citizens to the benevolence of others.”
