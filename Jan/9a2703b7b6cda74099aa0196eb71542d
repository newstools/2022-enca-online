The student organisation says R1-billion must be donated towards basic education. READ: Cosas vows to continue protests "Our quest in the JSE was very simple to say the JSE listed companies, with an understanding of course that the JSE is a market regulator of all these companies, these companies must play an active role in trying to contribute to the development of education in South Africa," said Cosas spokesperson Douglas Ngobeni. Ngobeni says they have submitted a memorandum with their requests to JSE CEO Leila Fourie. Watch the video above for more details.
