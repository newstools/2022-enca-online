 PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa says the handing over of the first part of the state capture inquiry report is a defining moment to end the era of state capture. Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo handed the report to the president earlier this afternoon at the Union Buildings. The report has been broken down into three volumes. Zondo says Part 2 of the report will deal further with SOE's, while part 3 will cover the rest of the entities that came up during the inquiry. A summary of the report will only be available once the complete report has been handed over.
