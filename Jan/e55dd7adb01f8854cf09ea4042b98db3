The driver, Philippe Boutron was involved in the non-racing incident along with five unhurt people in his car. Race director David Castera told France Info Boutron, was planning to compete in the Dakar Rally for the ninth time and he is also president of third-tier French football club Orleans. "His condition is improving and his repatriation to France is being prepared," Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) said. "His vehicle was brought to a sudden halt by a sudden explosion, the origin of which is still unknown at this stage. "The Saudi police immediately went to the scene and began their investigations," it added. The Saudi Interior Minister backed up ASO's statement. "There is no criminal suspicion in the accident that occurred to a support team vehicle for one of the drivers participating in Rally Dakar 2022," it tweeted. Later on Saturday, France's foreign ministry updated its advice on Saudi Arabia, contradicting ASO and the Saudi Interior Minister's comments about the incident. "An appeal for maximum alertness -- security risk," it said on its website. "An investigation by Saudi authorities is underway to determine the cause of this explosion. The possibility of a criminal act has not been ruled out," it added.
