AFP/Pool LONDON - Pomp, pageantry and puddings will form the centrepiece of celebrations to mark Queen Elizabeth II's 70 years on the throne, Buckingham Palace announced on Monday. The 95-year-old monarch's Platinum Jubilee begins on February 6 -- the date in 1952 when she became queen after the death of her father, King George VI. Britain's longest-serving monarch will be the only queen or king in the country's long history to have ruled for 70 years. Buckingham Palace officials unveiled a series of events to mark the occasion and reflect the Queen's call for the celebrations to promote a mood of national unity. Topping festivities that reflect national passions is a competition to create a new Jubilee pudding, with the winner chosen by judges including the palace head chef. The head of state will also be presented with a digital map showing every tree planted as part of the Queen's Green Canopy initiative. The Queen and her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, planted their own tree on the royal estate in Balmoral, northeast Scotland, last October. The main celebrations will be held over a four-day long weekend, kicking off with public holidays on Thursday, 2 June and Friday, 3 June. The annual event in central London marks the Queen's official birthday but has been cancelled for the last two years because of the coronavirus pandemic.
