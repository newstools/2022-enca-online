On 12 January, Njabulo Ndhlebe, Zukiso Majola and a third unnamed friend sneaked out of school and headed to Majola's house. Majola showed his friends his late grandfather's gun, which he had taken without his parents' knowledge during the December holidays. Majola loaded the gun and started playing with it. The gun went off accidentally, shooting Ndhlebe behind his ear. The third friend ran home, and in panic and fear, Majola turned the gun on himself. The memorial service for the two boys will be held at the school on Tuesday. Police are currently investigating a shooting incident at Lesiba Secondary School in Daveyton. It's alleged that a pupil shot another after an altercation. eNCA speaks to Gauteng Education Department MEC Panyaza Lesufi. Courtesy #DStv403
