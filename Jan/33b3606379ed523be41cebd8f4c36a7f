While the Tumahole community has had to adjust to fetching water with buckets over the years, they are fed up and have taken to the streets to protest for their basic human rights. eNCA’s Nkosazana Dambuza reports. Courtesy #DStv403 PARYS - No running water for 15 years. That’s the plight of Tumahole residents in the Free State. The elderly in particular are struggling, as they can’t walk far to fetch water. They are begging government to come to their aid. Other residents have taken to demonstrating their frustration. * eNCA’s Nkosazana Dambuza reports.
