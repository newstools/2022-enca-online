File: A golf ball. JOHANNESBURG - Martin Rohwer has won the Sunshine Tour’s Vodacom Origins of Golf Final. He took the title at the Gary Player Country Club by two strokes. Rohwer responded to the pressure well especially in the last three holes which were a little tighter. It's Rohwer's second Sunshine Tour title which saw him record a final round of two-under-par 70. This is despite a brief scare from Tristen Strydom, who moved to 11-under-par with two birdies and an eagle in his final four holes. But Rohwer held his nerve to record victory.
