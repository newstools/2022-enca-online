AFP/Alex Wong/Getty LOS ANGELES - With moviegoing slowed by the Covid-19 surge, "Spider-Man: No Way Home" easily clung to its box-office lead in North American theatres this weekend, industry data showed. The Sony/Marvel superhero film, with Tom Holland as the popular web-slinger, took in an estimated $11-million for the Friday-through-Sunday period, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported. The movie has now led the domestic box office in six of its seven weekends out. Its domestic total of $735.9-million places it fourth all-time, trailing "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" at $936.7-million, "Avengers: Endgame" at $858.4-million and -- possibly now within its reach -- "Avatar" at $760.5-million, according to Box Office Mojo, a division of the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). On a quiet weekend when pandemic-stung studios opted to issue no new wide releases, Paramount's latest chapter in the "Scream" franchise again took second place, grossing $7.4-million. As in the horror flick's 1996 original, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette again star. Third spot was also unchanged, with Universal's animated musical "Sing 2" taking in $4.8-million. Its all-star voice cast includes Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, Matthew McConaughey, Pharrell Williams and Bono. Hanging steady in fourth was Universal's Christian romance film "Redeeming Love," at $1.9-million. It offers a parable of sin and salvation in an Old West setting: California's 1849 Gold Rush. And "The King's Man," the spy action comedy from 20th Century, again made the top five, taking in $1.8-million. Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton, Rhys Ifans and Matthew Goode star.
