Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas celebrates winning his quarter-final against Italy's Jannik Sinner. AFP/Martin Keep MELBOURNE - Stefanos Tsitsipas stormed into his third Australian Open semi-final with a blistering straight-sets victory over Jannik Sinner on Wednesday. The Greek fourth seed played his best tennis yet in the year's opening major to romp past the 11th-seeded Italian 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in 2hr 6min and into a semi-final against either Daniil Medvedev or Felix Auger-Aliassime. It was a most impressive performance from the world number four who grasped control of the quarter-final on Rod Laver Arena with a break in Sinner's opening service game and did not relinquish his firm grip. "My humility helped a lot today, I knew I was going out on the court to face a very good player," Tsitsipas said. "I just focused on my very best shots and it paid off better than I thought. "Stepping on the court and having the crowd support is truly unbelievable." Not even a rain interruption which forced the stadium roof to be closed and change match conditions early in the second set stopped the Tsitsipas momentum. "It's part of the game. I knew I was heading in the right direction," Tsitsipas said. "The conditions might have changed a bit but so did my mind. I tried to adapt. It just worked." Last year's French Open finalist regained his timing and hit the ball majestically, reeling off 30 winners -- 17 on his forehand -- and breaking Sinner's serve four times.
