South Africa's Lloyd Harris. AFP/Joe Klamar ADELAIDE - South African Lloyd Harris has crashed out of the Adelaide International in the first round of play. Harris went down  5-7 7-5 6-4 to South Korean Kwon Soon-woo. It was a tough battle for both players with Harris banging in 20 aces in the match. Kwon managed to win four of his eight break points to secure victory. Harris's loss comes a week before the start of the Australian Open. The South African is in peak condition coming off a good run of matches in the US Open last September, where he lost to world number 3 Alexander  Zverev. Last year, Harris made it through to the third round of the Australian Open before bowing out.
