Neil Young has repeatedly voiced disdain for US President Donald Trump's use of his classic hits at rallies, asking him to stop. LOS ANGELES - Neil Young made good on his vow to have his music removed from Spotify after demanding the streaming service choose between him and Joe Rogan, the controversial podcaster accused of spreading disinformation. The prolific, legendary singer behind "Heart of Gold" and "Harvest Moon" had published an open letter this week accusing Spotify of "spreading fake information about vaccines -- potentially causing death" by putting out Rogan's podcast that racks up millions of listens. On Wednesday he published a second letter to his website, thanking his record company, Warner's Reprise Records for their support "in the name of truth." He said Spotify accounts for 60 percent of his music's global streaming income Young has deemed the stand worth it: "Spotify has become the home of life threatening COVID misinformation," he wrote. "Lies being sold for money." "I realized I could not continue to support SPOTIFY's life threatening misinformation to the music loving public." His music was expected to come down within hours, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported that the removal was confirmed. Young had 2.4 million followers and over six million monthly listeners on the popular streaming platform. Rogan has a multi-year exclusive deal with Spotify, reportedly to the tune of $100-million, and a massive following. But critics say his podcast is a platform for peddling conspiracy theories and disinformation, particularly over Covid-19.
