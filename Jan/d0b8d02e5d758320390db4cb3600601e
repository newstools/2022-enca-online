The Queen is at Windsor Castle after cancelling her traditional Christmas at her Sandringham estate. AFP/Pool LONDON - UK police said they were imposing a no-fly zone above Windsor Castle, one of Queen Elizabeth II's primary residences, after a security review. The announcement came after a 19-year-old man was arrested for breaking into the castle grounds armed with a crossbow on Christmas Day, as the monarch was spending a low-key festive season at Windsor. The region's Thames Valley Police force said that effective January 27, no aircraft can enter airspace up to 760 metres above the castle within a radius of 1.25 nautical miles without special permission. "This order is an additional method to keep the community living near to this iconic location safe," the force said in a statement.

The Queen usually celebrates Christmas at her Sandringham estate in eastern England, but she remained at Windsor Castle this time after the trip was cancelled owing to a surge in Omicron Covid infections. The teenager was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon. He was detained under the Mental Health Act. Queen Elizabeth -- already Britain's longest-reigning monarch -- is due to celebrate her Platinum Jubilee this year to mark 70 years since her accession to the throne in 1952. She was forced to cut back on public appearances after a health scare in October, which saw her spend a night in hospital.
