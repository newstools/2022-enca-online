Jansen, 21, who made his Test debut against India in the first Test at Centurion last week, is the only member of the squad not previously capped at ODI level. Wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock, who retired from Test cricket after the Centurion match, was also included. Fast bowler Anrich Nortje was again not available. Selection convener Victor Mpitsang said Nortje had not fully recovered from the hip injury which kept him out of the Test series.
