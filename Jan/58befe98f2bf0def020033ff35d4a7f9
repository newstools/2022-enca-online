"Up until the place is declared safe we do not want to see our members there at that site, not only our members but any worker should not be in that place at this point in time," said SAMWU's Bafana Zungu. "We are engaging the security company that is private that is providing a service for the municipality so those security guards, the service they are providing is our interest. So we cannot keep quiet even if they are private we have to provide security to them." * eNCA's Manqoba Mchunu reports.
