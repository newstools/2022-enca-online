Residents from villages in eMaxesibeni in the Eastern Cape say democracy hasn't reached them as yet. Earlier this week, pictures and videos emerged, showing people crossing a rickety wooden bridge. Residents say they have no option but to use the poorly constructed and unstable bridge to access supplies and medical care at clinics and hospitals. eNCA's senior journalist Aviwe Mtila visited the village and filed this report. MAXESIBENI, Eastern Cape - Earlier this week, pictures and videos of residents crossing a rickety wooden bridge outside eMaxesibeni, formerly Mount Ayliff in the Eastern Cape went viral. Residents in neighbouring villages have no option but to use the poorly constructed and unstable bridge to access supplies and medical care at clinics and hospitals. Built in 2001 as a donation from missionaries, this bridge was supposed to be a temporary measure to assist villagers across, stopping them from using ropes as they previously did. But 21 years later it's no longer intact, with some wooden pieces missing and cables snapped. Crossing here is a daily nightmare for many villagers. "I'm never comfortable using this bridge," said Boy Gwiliza. "But I have to use it daily to go to the doctor or town. I also visit my family on the other side. "It frightens me a lot and it's like I'm losing my mind sometimes when I cross." * eNCA's senior journalist Aviwe Mtila reports.
