Those implicated in the SIU report on Covid-19-related procurement are more than just corrupt. They are murderous, and there must be consequences. This is according to Accountability Now's Paul Hoffman. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Those implicated in the SIU report on COVID-19-related procurement are more than just corrupt. They are murderous and there must be consequences. Accountability Now's Paul Hoffman says that while the SIU's work is impressive, the job ahead will require even more manpower.

"The scale of the work that the SIU has done is massive and impressive but the one fact that sticks out for me is that the people involved in this are not just greedy, they really are murderous," Hoffman said.

"It is absolutely unforgivable and consequences need to flow. It is almost as if it is the endpoint of the culture of impunity that grew during the Zuma years and did not end when the Zuma years ended. The nature of the crime that is apparent in the report of the SIU is really quite beyond the pale and there's going to be a lot of work from a lot of institutions."
