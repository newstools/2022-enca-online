 JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA) will resume flights between Johannesburg and Durban from 4 March. There will be three daily return flights. The embattled airline abandoned the route two years ago. SAA's interim Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Kgokolo, says since operations resumed in 2021, the airline's customers and partners had been asking for the route to reopen.
