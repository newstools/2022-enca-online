AFP/Aamir Qureshi  KABUL - The Taliban have ordered shop owners in western Afghanistan to cut off the heads of mannequins, insisting the human figures violate Islamic law. A video clip showing men sawing the plastic heads off women figures went viral on social media. Since returning to power in August, the Taliban have increasingly imposed their harsh interpretation of Islamic law, severely curtailing freedoms, particularly those of women and girls.

"If they just cover the head or hide the entire mannequin, the angel of Allah will not enter their shop or house and bless them," he added, after some clothes vendors initially responded by covering the heads of mannequins with plastic bags or headscarves. The Taliban have so far issued no national policy on mannequins or statues.

Since seizing power, they have banned girls from secondary schools in several provinces while women have largely been prevented from working in the public sector and excluded from government positions. Last week authorities in Kabul said women seeking to travel long distances should not be offered road transport unless accompanied by a close male relative. The Islamists have increased raids on liquor sellers, rounded up drug addicts and banned music.
