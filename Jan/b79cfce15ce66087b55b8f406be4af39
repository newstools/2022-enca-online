Antonee Robinson sweeps home the winning goal in the USA's 1-0 World Cup qualifying victory over El Salvador. AFP/Emilee Chinn/Getty LOS ANGELES - Fulham defender Antonee Robinson scored the only goal as the United States edged closer to World Cup qualification on Thursday with a 1-0 win over El Salvador. Robinson swept home a finish on 52 minutes at a frigid Lower Field in Columbus, Ohio, to give the USA another precious three points in CONCACAF’s qualifying race for Qatar. But it was a largely unconvincing victory for US coach Gregg Berhalter's side, who laboured to break down a dogged El Salvador team who remain near the foot of the eight-team qualification table. The win leaves the US on top of the standings with 18 points from nine games, although Canada can reclaim top spot later Thursday depending on the outcome of their away game against Honduras. In other games on Thursday, Mexico reignited their push for qualification after snatching a battling 2-1 win over Jamaica in Kingston. Mexico are one point behind the US with 17 points from nine games. The game in Columbus had kicked off in freezing temperatures of around -1 degrees Celsius but the hosts failed to make the most of the advantage from the cold conditions. The US controlled possession in the first half but failed to make their dominance of possession and territory count. Jamaica were rocked by a red card for Damion Lowe but took a shock lead through Daniel Johnson in the 50th minute. But just when it looked as if Mexico were sliding to a third straight loss, Henry Martin’s header made it 1-1 on 82 minutes, and then moments later Alexis Vega swept in the winner after punishing slack marking at the back post.
