AFP/Odd Andersen PARIS - World Athletics Boss Sebastian Coe has confirmed that Russian athletes will be able to compete at the World Championships in Eugene, Oregon this July. High jump Olympic champion Mariya Lasitskene and women's two-time pole vault world champion Anzhelika Sidorov were unable to compete at the Eugene Diamond League leg last year as the US refused to provide travel visas. She called on the Russian Athletics Federation ( RusAF), the Sports Ministry and the Foreign Ministry to support her attempts to compete and ensure she could travel to the US. Coe has now confirmed Russian athletes will be able to compete in Eugene. Due to a World Anti-Doping Agency ruling, Russian athletes will compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes at international competitions. In December, it was confirmed the number of eligible Neutral Athletes from the Russian Federation at major events, including the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Belgrade in March and the World Athletics Championships in Oregon in July, would be doubled to 20.
