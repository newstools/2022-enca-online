Meghan Markle won a ruling in February that Associated Newspapers had breached her privacy. AFP/Pool LONDON - Meghan Markle, wife to Prince Harry, has won nominal damages of £1 from one of Britain's biggest newspaper groups after an appeals court ruled in her favour over a privacy case. The sum, equating to $1.40 or 1.20 euros, is payable by Associated Newspapers for misuse of private information, and it will also have to pay a "confidential sum" for infringing her copyright. A spokesperson for the Duchess of Sussex said the sum for copyright infringement was "substantial" and would be donated to charity. Details of last month's finding by the Court of Appeal in London emerged in a written case order divulged by lawyers for Associated, which publishes the Mail on Sunday newspaper and MailOnline.

Associated had said it was mulling a further appeal to the UK's Supreme Court after a High Court judge initially ruled in the former TV actress's favour last year without a full trial. But according to the BBC, "the company has now accepted defeat in the long-running case". The duchess had sued Associated over the publication in 2019 by the Mail on Sunday of a letter she had written to her estranged father.

Last month, Markle apologised to the appeals court after admitting she had allowed a former aide to brief the authors of a favourable biography of her short tenure as a frontline royal in Britain, despite previous denials on the matter. Markle and Harry now live in California after stepping down from royal duties in 2019. They have taken legal action against a number of publications, alleging invasion of privacy.
