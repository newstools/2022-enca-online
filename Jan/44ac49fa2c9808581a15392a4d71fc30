Video circulating on social media showed Stephane Claireaux, an MP from Macron's ruling party, being pelted at the weekend with seaweed and dirt by jeering protesters outside his home on the windswept territory off the Canadian island of Newfoundland. The incident was "intolerable" and "unacceptable" the president said during a visit to southern French city Nice, complaining of "an intensification of violence" against elected officials. Sunday's attack came a few days ahead of the introduction of France's health pass in Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, home to fewer than 6,000 people. The measure, long in place in mainland France, requires people to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to enter public spaces like bars. "We have to condemn such attacks, because in the end it's totalitarianism if you subject local or national elected officials to physical pressure... That's not acceptable in a democracy," minister for relations with parliament Marc Fesneau said. Claireaux had earlier told broadcaster France Info that he had been waiting for the demonstrators outside his home "so as to talk to them". "There was a car loaded with seaweed... and people started chucking it at me. It was like being stoned. My wife came out to join me on the front step. I dodged a rock that missed our faces by five centimetres," he said. Claireaux added that he would be filing criminal charges against those responsible. "People are free to think that we're not making the right decisions. We're all getting death threats by email. At some point this has to stop," he said.
