Security conducts checks at the Old Peter Mokaba stadium in Limpopo. The ANC is celebrating 110 years today. POLOKWANE - The ANC has tight security at the January 8th celebrations today. The party's spokesperson, Pule Mabe says they have learned critical lessons from previous events. "Of course you'll understand that we are dealing with a new normal. Its effectively for the first time now since the start of the pandemic that we convening physically our January 8th statement. We have got to make sure that everyone who comes to the stadium have been accredited, to do so feels safe, including yourself, it is just part of that. This has been a clear directive from us at DIP that we make sure because you will remember that we had glitches with our own accreditation system, so I had to make a call as the head of DIP that when you are being marshalled in, further security checks must be undertaken to make sure that it is the right person who end up in the stadium. We did say we are going to draw, we have drawn critical lessons what came out of  MaLilian Ngoyi's memorial which the women's league had to request it gets to be shelved off because their numbers were over-subscribed. You need to now act in this manner to avoid any possible potential over-subscription," said Pule. The ANC has tight security at the January 8th celebrations in Polokwane today.
