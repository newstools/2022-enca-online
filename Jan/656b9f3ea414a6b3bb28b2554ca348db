 EPISODE SUMMARY: Another year of ups and downs – massive highs and dizzying lows. While #TheDeviShow takes a break from the world of crooks and scamsters – we’re leaving you (and 2021) with this episode of laughs – take a break, have a laugh (or two) and here’s hoping that 2022 brings us all health, peace and prosperity! STEVE HARVEY It's hard to believe that iconic Hollywood actor and comedian, Steve Harvey was once a stuttering little boy born in West Virginia to a coal miner and a Sunday school teacher. But when he brought down the house at an open mic event in 1985, he realised he had to take a leap of faith in order to soar. But reaching stardom took sheer determination and today he is a global brand, boasting 14 Emmy nominations and his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We met up with the inspirational comedian in June, while on set, shooting the latest season of popular game show - Family Feud for eTV. ALFRED ADRIAAN Engaging and enigmatic - comedian Alfred Adriaan has made the most of the Covid pandemic raking in thousands of viewers on his hilarious vlogs. From digital farts to township dogs and Coloured 21st birthday parties – Alfred has kept us rolling in our lounges while his wife, Natalie is now a firm favourite because of her dismissive approach to her funnyman husband. We talk to the comedian about his journey from small town shopkeeper's son to social media sensation. LOYISO GOLA Who would believe that comedian, Loyiso Gola was shy and reserved when he was a young boy? Nobody in his massive fan base, that’s for sure! Today, the Gugulethu-born, award winning funny man, is considered to be one of the most acclaimed standup comics in the country. Twice nominated for an Emmy for The Late Nite News Show, which he hosted for a whopping 11 seasons on eTV and eNCA, Loyiso made history earlier this year with the first-ever Netflix original one-hour standup comedy show, Unlearning.
