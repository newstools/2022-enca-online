AFP/William West MELBOURNE - Novak Djokovic intends to play the Australian Open in 2023, tournament chief Craig Tiley said while blaming "miscommunication" for his deportation ahead of this year's event. The world number one's visa was cancelled ahead of the season-opening Grand Slam over his Covid-19 vaccination status, an incident that tarred the lead-up. He flew out of Melbourne a week ago after falling in a last-gasp bid to stay and target a record 21st major title following a protracted legal battle with Australian authorities.

"Obviously, he's got to play out this year, but that will be his intention," he told public broadcaster ABC. "At the end of the day, he's the number one player in the world and he really loves the Australian Open."

"Rafa (Nadal) had it right. It could all have been avoided if he just got vaccinated, and that fellow might think he's bigger than the tournament. He's not," Andrews told reporters. "That's why the tournament's happening without him. And it's a great success."

"It will hurt him for a long time and it will be difficult to get it out of his head," he told the Sport.sk website, while blasting the "unjust political process" that led to Djokovic being booted out.
