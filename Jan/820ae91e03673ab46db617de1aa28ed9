Keegan Petersen helped South Africa recover after Aiden Markram was an early dismissal. AFP/Rodger Bosch CAPE TOWN - Keegan Petersen led a South African recovery after an early shock on the second day of the series-deciding third Test against India at Newlands on Wednesday. South Africa were 100 for three at lunch, with Petersen unbeaten on 40, in reply to India’s first innings total of 223. Petersen had to face the third ball of the morning after Aiden Markram padded up and was bowled by an in-swinger from Jasprit Bumrah without a run added to the overnight 17 for one. On a sunny morning, in contrast to the overcast conditions of the first day, Petersen and nightwatchman Keshav Maharaj took the total to 45 before Maharaj was bowled by Umesh Yadav for 25. Rassie van der Dussen joined Petersen and scored 17 not out in an unbroken partnership of 55.
