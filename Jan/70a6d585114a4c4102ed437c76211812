Toyota's Qatari driver Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar and French co-driver Mathieu Baumel compete during Stage 4 of the Dakar 2022. AFP/Franck Fife RIYADH - Dakar Rally leader Nasser Al-Attiyah took Wednesday's fourth stage in Riyadh after Saudi driver Yazeed Al-Rajhi was caught out by a speeding penalty. The home hope led the timings after the 465-kilometre trek across the desert from Qaisumah. But a two-minute sanction dropped him down to fifth, with Al-Attiyah handed the stage to add to his success in the prologue and first stage. Al-Attiyah explained the inherited win had come at a price. "We tried to set a high pace, but our plan was not having to open tomorrow (Thursday) because there will be no bikes and, therefore, no tracks," he said. "But, even if we falter a bit tomorrow in these conditions, it will put us in a favourable position for the next day." The Qatari, seeking a fourth Dakar title behind the wheel of a Toyota, pulled a further 25seconds clear of Sebastien Loeb in the overall car rankings to lead the French rally star by 38mins 05sec. "We are moving in the right direction day after day," commented Al-Attiyah, whose Dakar titles came driving for three different constructors - Volkswagen in 2011, Mini in 2015 and Toyota four years later. Loeb, runner-up in the stage ahead of Carlos Sainz in Audi's new hybrid, had his prospects of overall victory dented on Tuesday after his car's prop shaft broke after just 10km. Wednesday's testing stage, the longest on this year's route, caught out Spain's Nani Roma, winner on two wheels in 2004 and four wheels in 2014, and France's Guerlain Chicherit. Both walked away unscathed after crashes, their cars turned upside down. Before Saturday's well-earned rest day in Riyadh come two stages around the Saudi capital.
