Police Minsiter Bheki Cele says while he does not suspect sabotage, there was interference with the electricity system. WATCH | January 8 statement | ANC hosts gala dinner Cele says those responsible must face the consequences. "I wouldn't call it a sabotage but somebody did do something that was not supposed to happen," he said. "When you go to the thing, only the hall that lost the lights, even the plugs where the president was speaking did not lose the fire so that the engine can come up. Clearly, someone who has a good know-how, clearly had his bad intentions, if you call that a sabotage then let that be but that is the person we need to find as the SAPS."
