The National Prosecuting Authority has announced the formation of a special state capture unit for the recovery of looted state funds. Advocate Paul Hoffman, director of Accountability Now, argues that the criminal justice process can be long and has a high bar for guilt, whereas civil claims can be a lot speedier to resolve. He spoke with eNCA's Sally Burdett about the recovery of stolen funds.

A joint statement released by the NPA and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation says they will work together to build cases and bring those involved in state capture to book.

They are "systematically reviewing the commission's findings and recommendations, with a view to investigating and building cases for criminal prosecution against those who broke the law, be they from the public or private sectors," the statement said. "Rebuilding the NPA... was never going to be quick or easy," it said. "Yet, significant progress has been made, and the NPA is slowly but surely being rebuilt to enable it to deliver on its vital mandate."
