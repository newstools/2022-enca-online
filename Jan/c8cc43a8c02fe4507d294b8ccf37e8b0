The goal: turn it into an entertainment venue. The orange ferry John F. Kennedy, which was commissioned in 1965, was sold by New York City to Paul Italia, a real estate agent who owns a comedy club called "The Stand," and other investors including Davidson and Jost, both cast members of the long-standing comedy show "Saturday Night Live," Italia told AFP. The sale -- through an auction that concluded this week -- was first reported by The New York Times. Both men are natives of Staten Island, one of New York's boroughs, and Davidson still lives there. The city says the ferry they have acquired is 85 meters long, weighs around 2,100 tons and was retired from the fleet last year when its engines broke down. These investors won the auction with a bid of $280,100. "The idea is to turn the space into a live entertainment event space with comedy, music, art, food, etc.," Italia told AFP.
