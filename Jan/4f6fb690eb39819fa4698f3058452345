 JOHANNESBURG -  The United Arab Emirates has lifted its travel ban on South Africa and four other African countries. These include Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Uganda, and Angola. Emirates had initially extended its flight suspensions which were due to lapse at the end of last year. All passenger travel will resume from Saturday. Air travel was slapped with several bans following the discovery of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in November last year. Qatar Airways resumed outbound flights from South Africa on 13 January. Many other countries, including EU nations, the US, the UK and Canada have dropped their bans.  We are pleased to announce that flights to and from South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe will resume starting 29 January. https://t.co/JSkmmxPlzk 1/2 pic.twitter.com/RkZM0eG31N
