WATCH: Calls for Patel to address jobs bloodbath at Clover Workers claim clover withheld their 13th cheque which was due on 25 November. Giwusa president Mametlwe Sebei said: "We have argued that the company not to pay bonuses is unlawful. "We just didn’t go to CCMA with representatives, we mobilised, we demonstrated at CCMA offices to emphasise the urgency and necessity of this payment to be done no later than Friday because our members went to festive season without bonuses which they're entitled to by law."
