Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - It seems like this year's State of the Nation Address will be a rather costly affair. Parliament's spokesperson says they’ll have to fork out more because the event has been moved to Cape Town City Hall, which doesn't have any of the resources and equipment they need. In a statement on Friday, Parliament says it won't allow its work to be derailed or disrupted. READ: SONA to be held at Cape Town City Hall The fire, which began at the weekend, gutted all of the chambers of the National Assembly. Police swiftly arrested a lone straggler in the precinct who was charged with arson and housebreaking. "Now that the decision has been made by the presiding officers, the staff under the executive leadership of Parliament and various stakeholders... we have to start today and every day until the 10th of February," said Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo.

Remember the reason we've been able to reduce gradually the expenditure around SONA is because we already have the venue and everything else, we don't have that. "We're going to a City Hall that is empty and we need to bring our own chairs, our own sound system etc so we don't know how much we're going to spend but will be able to provide such answers to the public once we are done."
