AFP/Mauro Pimentel RIYADH - Authorities in Saudi Arabia were investigating after a samba performance by dancers some considered too scantily clad for the conservative kingdom, which has been diversifying its entertainment options. Over the past week, videos on social media have shown three foreign samba dancers displaying their moves in a main street of Jazan, in the southwest. The women, who were taking part in the Jazan Winter Festival, wore coloured feathers emblematic of the Brazilian tradition with their legs, arms and bellies uncovered. But they did not show as much flesh as samba dancers during Rio de Janeiro's annual carnival parades. State-run El-Ekhbariya TV aired footage of the festival but blurred images of the women. "Shows are for entertainment, not to attack good ways and to go against religion and social morals," one Jazan resident, Mohammed al-Bajwi told the channel. On social media many others were indignant, demanding punishment for those responsible for the event. In Saudi Arabia, most local women still wear traditional cloak-like robes in public.
