Poitier, who held dual US and Bahamian nationality, was "an icon, a hero, a mentor, a fighter, a national treasure," Deputy Prime Minister Chester Cooper said on his official Facebook page. The actor was the first black and Bahamian man to win a Best Actor Oscar for Lilies of the Field. Poitier played Nelson Mandela in the television movie Mandela and De Klerk in 1997. He was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002 for his "extraordinary performances" on the silver screen and his "dignity, style and intelligence" off of it.
