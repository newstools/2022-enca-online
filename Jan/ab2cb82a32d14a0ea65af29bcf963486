This after President Cyril Ramaphosa received the first part of the state capture inquiry report. The report implicates US management consultancy firm Bain & Co and former SARS boss Tom Moyane in state capture.

He testified against the global consulting company at the Zondo Commission last year. Williams says it's vital to start prosecuting those implicated in the report and that Ramaphosa should move to properly resource prosecutors to handle these cases.

"I'm looking closely at what the president will say to parliament because if it's not major resourcing up of law enforcement capabilities, I think we're then fooling ourselves and the commission would've been a waste of time. "I don't think it's a waste of time. The president needs to take seriously about resourcing up our prosecuting authorities and resourcing up the support of whistleblowers. Failing that then it's difficult to see how things will be different from what we've seen in the past."
