Ten people have been confirmed dead so far in the Eastern Cape floods. A woman from Mdantsane was among the lucky ones. She survived by holding onto a tree stump but she lost her 18-year-old daughter to the raging waters. Meanwhile, the premier has admitted they need to improve their response to natural disasters. eNCA's Nceba Ntlanganiso filed this report. #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403
