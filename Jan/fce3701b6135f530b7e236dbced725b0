"Piotr Zyla tested positive for Covid-19," PZN said on Twitter. Poland's ski jumping team are due to fly to China on January 31 but Zyla could also fly with Polish officials on February 3, according to Polish media. The Games are going ahead with the general public locked out because of the pandemic. China has a zero-Covid policy and all athletes will be kept in a "bubble" for the duration of the Games.
