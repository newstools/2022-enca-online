READ: State capture inquiry report | Calls mount for arrests, charges Executive director, Shenila Mohamed explained: "We are calling on [President Cyril] Ramaphosa, to say if government wants to be taken seriously, this is not the time for reassurance or words. The time is long passed for that. "The only way that people will start to believe that there is justice in this country is if we start seeing accountability, heads rolling and prosecutions. We are saying don't let this be another one of those commissions. We need to start seeing movement and we need to start seeing movement quickly."
