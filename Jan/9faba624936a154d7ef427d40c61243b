File: Petrol pumps seen at a local petrol station. eNCA JOHANNESBURG - A bit of good news for South African motorists in the new year. Fuel prices are set to decrease on Wednesday. Petrol prices for both 95 and 93 unleaded will decreases by 68 cents and 71 cents per litre. Diesel will decrease by 67 cents per litre. Local fuel prices are determined by international oil prices - as well as the dollar-rand value, as South Africa buys oil in the dollar. While the price of Brent crude steadily rose over the past month, there has been a decline in local oil import prices, subsequently counteracting the weakening rand. The reduction comes as a great relief for holidaymakers that plan to return home from holiday.
