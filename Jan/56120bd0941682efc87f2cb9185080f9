After losing his left leg to cancer as a football-loving 19-year-old in 1996, Patrick Selepe’s interest was not diminished. Selepe eventually found his sporting home on the tennis court -- first as a player, and later as an umpire. He is determined to open up this world to others too, as eNCA sports reporter Hloni Mtimkulu found out. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Chair umpire Patrick Selepe made history last year. He became the first person with a disability to officiate at the Paralympic Games. Selepe was a pioneer even before then, with his presence felt in the early days of wheelchair tennis in South Africa. He is determined to open up this world to others too. * eNCA's Hloni Mtimkulu reports.
