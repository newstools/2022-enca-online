The 57-year-old had been ineligible for a human transplant due to very poor health. The pig was genetically modified to eliminate some genes that would've been rejected by the recipient's body. Doctors say the man is recovering well after the seven-hour operation. Surgeons are hoping the transplant will solve a worldwide organ shortage.
