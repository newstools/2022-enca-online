AFP/Fabrice Coffrini PARIS - Maserati is to return to single-seater car championships for the first time since Juan-Manuel Fangio won the 1957 Formula One title in the 2023 Formula E competition, the Italian marque announced. Maserati's decision is a boost to the championship -- first run in 2014 -- with last year's title-winning outfit Mercedes EQ announcing they are quitting the championship at the end of 2022. Mercedes' fellow German constructors Audi and BMW left in 2021. "We are very proud to be back where we belong as protagonists in the world of racing," said Maserati CEO Davide Grasso in a statement. "We have a long history of world-class excellence in competition, and we are ready to drive performance in the future." The 2022 season consists of 16 races beginning at the end of January in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia.
