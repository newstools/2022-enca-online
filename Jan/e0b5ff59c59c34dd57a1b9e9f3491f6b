The samba school parades originally scheduled for late next month will instead be held in late April, authorities said in a joint statement, citing the pandemic and "the need to save lives." Brazil has been hit extremely hard by the pandemic. Raucous street celebrations associated with one of the world's biggest parties have already been cancelled altogether for the second year in a row.

In the case of Rio, the procession of schools unfolds in a stadium called the Sambadrome, which can hold 70,000 people. The spectacle draws tourists from elsewhere in Brazil and around the world. This is being allowed to go ahead, at least for now and later than originally scheduled, because authorities can control who goes into the arena and demand proof of vaccination, for instance.

We can carry out the procession much more safely in late April," said Rio's top health official, Daniel Soranz. "Looking at the curve of the pandemic in other countries, we think it is very unlikely that the current wave will last until April," he added. The pandemic has killed more than 622,000 people in Brazil -- a toll surpassed only by that of the United States -- and this country is in the middle of yet another wave, fueled by the Omicron variant of the virus.
