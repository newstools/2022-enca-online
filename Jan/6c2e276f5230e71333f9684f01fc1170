French adventurer Jean-Jacques Savin. AFP/Philippe Lopez AZORES - A 75-year-old Frenchman attempting to row across the Atlantic "to laugh at old age" was found dead in his cabin at sea Saturday, his support team said. Portugal's coastguard found Jean-Jacques Savin's overturned boat off the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores on Friday. They were able to send a diver down on Saturday to search it, his team added. The former paratrooper's body "was found lifeless inside the cabin", they said. The avid triathlete set off from mainland Portugal's southern tip on January 1, but there had been no contact with him since overnight Thursday to Friday when he activated two distress beacons. It was just his latest adventure after crossing the Atlantic alone in a custom-built barrel in 2019, a 127-day trip followed by thousands on Facebook. Savin was hoping again to reach the Caribbean, this time in a rowing boat eight metres long and 1.70 metres wide, with a rowing station at its centre. His team earlier on Saturday said they were "very worried". "We haven't heard from him since Friday morning," they said, adding that he had activated "two distress beacons, telling us he was 'in great difficulty'." Savin, who said rowing across the Atlantic was a way to "laugh at old age", celebrated his 75th birthday on Friday last week on board his two-cabin boat.
