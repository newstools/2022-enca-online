Augrabies National Park. eNCA/Monique Mortlock JOHANNESBURG - Waterflow from the Orange River to the Augrabies Falls National Park in the Northern Cape has increased. Over the past week, we have been inundated by magnificent scenes of the 56 metre high Augrabies Falls. The National Park says the flow to the waterfall has risen to over 3,000 cubic metres per second.

The National Park will remain open to the public but due to the strong flow, three of the seven viewing decks are closed. Guests are urged to be cautious of wet and slippery conditions.
