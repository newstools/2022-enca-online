Hlophe says Mafe must be released to a normal correctional facility with immediate effect. The ruling means the bail hearing will go ahead on Saturday. Judge Hlophe said, "the order that I'm going to make today [Tuesday] is as follows. Number one, in other words the matter is heard and is urgent. Number 2 setting aside the referral of the accused to hospital." "The matter is set down for bail application on Saturday. The application succeeds with costs, the respondent is ordered to pay the costs... Further detention of Mabe in hospital is unlawful and should come to end with immediate effect. He should be released first thing tomorrow [Wednesday] morning and taken to a normal correctional centre. That order was made improperly and unlawfully."
