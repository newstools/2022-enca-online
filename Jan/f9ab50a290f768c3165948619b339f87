READ: The days of cadre deployments are over - Mashaba DA MP Leon Schreiber said: “Cadre deployment did not end when Jacob Zuma resigned. It continues unabated in the Ramaphosa administration, and because cadre deployment continues, state capture continues. "We will not end state capture until we abolish cadre deployment. This historic moment gives us an opportunity to truly end cadre deployment for all political parties. "No political party should have a secret committee sitting somewhere and deciding who gets appointed to positions in the state that are not supposed to be political positions.”
