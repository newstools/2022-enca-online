Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa has commended the Fire Emergency Services for the swift response after a building in the Parliamentary precinct  caught fire. The president says that they have done a fantastic job. And had they not responded on time, the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces would be down to ashes. "They intervened at the right time, it does seem like the sprinkler system did not work as it was supposed to".
