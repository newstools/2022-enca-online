AFP/Marty Melville CHRISTCHURCH - New Zealand beat Bangladesh by an innings and 117 runs to draw the two-match Test Series inside three days in Christchurch. After making history by winning their first Test by eight wickets for their first victory in any format in New Zealand, Bangladesh found the going tough in the second Test. This after the Black Caps declared at 521/6, thanks to 252 runs by skipper Tom Latham and a century by Devon Conway. The touring Tigers were bowled out for 278 in their second innings after following on. This despite Litton Das's counter-attack in the third session. He posted his second Test century, one of the highlights of the day. Meanwhile, Ross Taylor received a memorable farewell from Test cricket when he took the last wicket of Ebadot Hossain. The 37-year-old Taylor has called time on international cricket.
