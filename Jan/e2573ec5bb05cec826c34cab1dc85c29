Mali's forward Ibrahima Kone (C) scores a goal during the Group F Afron 2021 football match between Tunisia and Mali. AFP/Issouf Sanogo LIMBE - Mali has beaten Tunisia by an odd goal in Group F's Africa Cup of Nations encounter. But it's the Zambian referee Janny Sikazwe who grabbed the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Sikazwe first blew for full-time with five minutes remaining before realising he had made a mistake. He bizarrely restarted the match by handing Mali possession of the ball. After the restart, only four minutes were played as he ended the match controversially after 89 minutes on the clock. Carthage Eagles coach Mondher Kebaier and his technical staff rushed onto the field at full-time after Sikazwe failed to add any injury time. The second half saw two stoppages for video assistant referee checks, as well as a drinks break. Ibrahima Kone's penalty won it, with Mali keeper Ibrahim Mounkoro later saving a spot-kick from Wahbi Khazri. The second 45 minutes also had several substitutions in five separate windows.
