The companies are accused of misconduct involving state-owned entities at the peak of state capture. The commission found no evidence that Nedbank ever asked for proof that the Airports Company had authorised a dodgy contract with Regiments.

In a statement Nedbank said: “We take note of the concerns expressed by the Zondo Commission… there has been no wrong-doing on the part of Nedbank in relation to these transactions.” Meanwhile, PwC was found to have failed to adequately act as a watchdog over SAA's books.

While we made mistakes in our work with SARS, we remain confident that we did not in any way willfully or knowingly support state capture at SARS or elsewhere.”
