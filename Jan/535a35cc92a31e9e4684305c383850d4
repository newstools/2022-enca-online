Coleman and his wife Audrey founded the Detainees Parents Support Committee in 1981. It provided food, clothing and legal assistance to prisoners during Apartheid. He went on to become a Human Rights Commissioner and, along with his wife, was awarded the Order of Luthuli, Silver by President Cyril Ramaphosa just a few months ago. The family says there will be a private funeral service followed by a public memorial to celebrate his life.  @MYANC mourns the loss of patriot and human rights activist, Dr. Max Coleman #RIPDrMaxColeman pic.twitter.com/hmXfQZkYiC
