But they are predicting a stronger recovery this year once the Omicron wave passes. Although tourism improved following the catastrophic levels of 2020 when the pandemic first hit, the recovery was "partial" and "full of ups and downs", Exceltur vice-president Jose Luis Zoreda told a news conference.

International tourism was worst hit, with only 31 million people visiting Spain, according to Exceltur, a figure far from the government's aim of attracting 45 million visitors -- or around half of the arrivals seen in 2019. Before the pandemic, Spain was the world's second most popular tourist destination after France, but it has suffered particularly from the drop in British travellers who had previously been the largest national group of visitors.

But Exceltur said it saw the situation improving this year with the passing of the Omicron wave that has slowed the sector's recovery. Oscar Perelli, head of research for Exceltur said the industry would likely experience "a very complex first quarter" with sales a third lower than 2019 levels, but was expecting to see "a marked upturn from April onwards".
