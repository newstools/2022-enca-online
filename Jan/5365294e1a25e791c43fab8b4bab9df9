Team captains will be the players who led each conference in voting, which at the moment remain Durant and Curry. They will pick rosters from available players regardless of conference. Memphis guard Ja Morant moved from third to second in Western Conference backcourt voting to seize the lead for a starting berth while Atlanta's Trae Young rose to second among Eastern Conference guards to move into a starter's spot. In the West, Morant was second behind Curry on 1,633,313 votes to edge ahead of Slovenia's Luka Doncic of Dallas, who was third on 1,410,605. A week ago, Doncic led Morant by 118,657 votes. Trailing James in the West frontcourt were Denver's Nikola Jokic of Serbia on 3,016,380 and Golden State's Andrew Wiggins on 1,829,733. Wiggins nosed 56,286 ahead of fourth-place Paul George of the Los Angeles Clippers, who was ahead of Wiggins by 139,236 votes a week ago. In the East frontcourt, Durant is trailed by Greek star Giannis Antetokounmpo of the reigning champion Milwaukee Bucks, who ranks fourth overall on 3,808,458, and Philadelphia's Cameroonian big man Joel Embiid on 2,357,404.
