eNCA's Faith Mangope speaks to political commentator Oliver Dickson about the ANC and its January 8th celebrations. The ANC is celebrating 110 years today. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Is the ANC under attack? Political Commentator Oliver Dickson believes that question can only be answered by President Cyril Ramaphosa himself. The party is celebrating its 110th birthday today in Polokwane. But the road to this day has been a challenging one. LIVE BLOG: ANC's 110th celebrations "The ANC is as strong today as it ever will be and will progressively get weaker. It cannot get stronger than what it currently is. The president will have to address the elephant in the room at the top of the mind in particular ANC member... is the ANC under some sort of domestic terrorism attack from within? The burning of Parliament, the vandalising of the Constitutional Court, the July unrest and now an event where the lights go out where the president is speaking. Which is not just indicative of the dysfuntional state of our electricity crisis, we can't necessarily attribute this to Eskom but its symbolic. What it signaled really was a security crisis. If I'm the president, a week after Parliament got burned down and the Constitutional Court got vandalised and the lights go out in a venue with more than a 100 people, immediately there should be panic about whether or not this is once again an attempt on the state and this time an attack on the safety of the executive and the head of the executive suffering thereof, that will be the elephant in the room and the people will ask, is this a display of internal ANC factional battles and the answer is, it might just be", said Oliver Dickson, political commentator.
