Duane Vermeulen (R) won the Rugby World Cup in 2019. AFP/Paul Faith PARIS - South Africa's Rugby World Cup winner Duane Vermeulen scored his first Ulster try as the Irish province beat Clermont 34-31 on Saturday to finish second in Pool A of the European Champions Cup. Vermeulen bundled over with half an hour left on his fourth appearance for the Ravenhill outfit after joining from the Blue Bulls in September. The 1999 champions were already guaranteed a knock-out place before the game and the French side, runners-up on three occasions, joined their opponents in the next round after Glasgow Warriors lost 38-30 to La Rochelle in the day's final game. Jacobus van Tonder, Alivereti Raka and Judicael Cancoriet crossed for Clermont in the final quarter of an hour but the late rally was insufficient to claim a first win in Ireland since 2014. "We played some fantastic rugby to get to 30 points to not very many and against Clermont (that) was a testament to the way that we played," Ulster head coach Dan McFarland said. "The fact that in the last 10 to 15 minutes we sat on our laurels was for me as a coach very disappointing." Later, Vermeulen's Springboks team-mate Raymond Rhule scored his third try in five games as La Rochelle, last year's runners-up in both Europe and the Top 14, overcame Glasgow. The Scottish outfit must wait for Montpellier's result to see if they are to advance to the next round.
