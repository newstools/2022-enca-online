India's Virat Kohli looks on as the India team warms up. AFP/Phill Magakoe CAPE TOWN - Indian captain Virat Kohli on Monday brushed aside concerns about his form as he looked ahead to the decisive third Test against South Africa starting at Newlands on Tuesday. Without a century in his past 14 Tests, Kohli said he believed he was still making important contributions to the team. "I don't look at myself from the lens that the outside world looks at me with," said the 33-year-old who has been a fixture in the Test team since making his debut against the West Indies in 2011. "The standards that they are talking about have been set by myself, they are not an utterance from outside. "I take a lot of pride in wanting to do the best thing for the team and wanting to perform regularly for the team. "I have been able to do that for a long period of time." Kohli's last Test hundred came against Bangladesh in Kolkata over two years ago in November 2019 but he said he had still been contributing. "As a player and a batsman I have been involved in many important moments for the team over the last calendar year or so," he said. "I have been part of very important partnerships when the team needed me and those moments have been crucial for us in many Test matches. "I’m at peace with how I am playing." His opposite number Dean Elgar, whose 96 not out guided South Africa to a memorable victory in the second Test at the Wanderers last week, believes India will be a better team with Kohli back in the line-up. “Virat brings a different dynamic to the game,” said Elgar. "His team missed him no doubt, from a captaincy point of view and maybe a strategy point of view. "He's a world-class player and very experienced. He's one of the more respected cricketers around." Kohli said he was fully fit after missing India's defeat in the second Test in Johannesburg because of a back spasm.
