The ANC NEC Lekgotla takes place this weekend as the party faces intense factional battles. eNCA's Govan Whittles reports. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The ANC's alliance partners are questioning the efficacy of the party's Lekgotla. The question was raised in a leaked report from the National Working Committee. READ: Mashatile steps into ANC Secretary-General role The report shows that the issue was raised at an Alliance Secretariat meeting on 18 January. Cosatu and the SACP are not convinced the Lekgotla is being used to advance the party's programmes. They are also concerned with inefficiencies in the public service. The partners are concerned that political leaders are being duped by bureaucrats. They say officials easily convince political heads that policies and programmes are being implemented. Cosatu and the SACP are scheduled to make their inputs at the Lekgotla on Saturday afternoon. The meeting is a platform to fine-tune the party’s programme of action and plays an influential role in what the Cabinet Lekgotla normally discusses. This year’s Cabinet Lekgotla is scheduled for next week.
