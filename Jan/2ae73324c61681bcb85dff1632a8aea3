The festival takes place each year in the western US state of Utah and had been planning a hybrid format later this month, featuring physical events with strict health protocols and virtual screenings. "Despite the most ambitious protocols, the Omicron variant with its unexpectedly high transmissibility rates is pushing the limits of health safety, travel and other infrastructures across the country," said organizers in a statement.

Among the selected films this year will be "jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy," a documentary assembled from more than two decades of footage shot by West's longtime friend Clarence "Coodie" Simmons. The 2022 Sundance Film Festival runs from 20 to 30 January.
