Novak Djokovic is safely into the semi-finals in Turin. AFP/Marco Bertorello PARIS - There were no ATP points for Novak Djokovic's victory in the law courts on Monday but the Serb remains comfortably the world's top-ranked men's player ahead of next week's Australian Open. Djokovic, who may still be excluded from the year's first grand slam event because of his Covid-19 vaccination status, remains over 2000 points clear of second-ranked Daniil Medvedev to claim the number one spot for the 355th week in his career. On Monday a judge ordered that Djokovic, who had been held since landing in Australia last Wednesday "be released immediately and forthwith from immigration detention".

The Australian government's lawyer said Monday that Immigration Minister Alex Hawke may decide to use his "personal power of cancellation" on the Serb's visa despite the player's legal victory. Behind Djokovic, the week's biggest winner was Felix Auger-Aliassime who moved up to a career-best ninth after helping Canada to win the ATP Cup at the weekend.

As a result of his rise, the Pole Hubert Hurkacz (10th) and the Italian Janik Sinner (11th) both slip back one place. Auger-Aliassime's Canada teammate Denis Shapovalov remains at 14, ahead of the Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut who is up two spots to 17. Frenchman Gael Monfils returned to the Top 20 in 19th position, a rise of two places, thanks to his victory over Karen Khachanov at the Adelaide International on Sunday.
