 JOHANNESBURG - Old Mutual has succeeded in having former Old Mutual CEO Peter Moyo's case thrown out with costs due to a lack of evidence that the company did anything wrong. Moyo, axed by the insurer in 2019, wanted R250m in damages. In December, he abandoned his bid to be reinstated, as it would have required his replacement Iain Williamson to join the trial, causing further delays in legal proceedings. Moyo is still awaiting judgment on another case in which he wants the directors of Old Mutual declared as delinquent. However, the insurer and financial institution say Monday's judgment vindicates its decision to terminate Moyo's contract.
