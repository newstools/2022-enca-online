Frustrations are growing over the closure of the left lane of the N1 south in Centurion. This follows the massive sinkhole that emerged over the weekend. Sanral has since called in geotechnical specialists to help with the assessment. The agency's Northern Region manager, Progress Hlahla, speaks more on this. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Sanral says it's unclear when the repairs will be completed to the N1 South sinkhole in Centurion. The massive sinkhole that emerged over the weekend has resulted in the closure of the left lane just before Botha Avenue. The agency has since called in geotechnical specialists to help with the assessment. "At this time it's too very difficult to to give a date when the construction will be done," said Progress Hlahla. "It will take us a bit of time to finalise the designs, no timeline as yet. We are treating it with the utmost emergency."
