AFP/Christiaan Kotze JOHANNESBURG - The Proteas return to action on Monday against India for the second Test at the Wanderers as they seek to level the series one-all. South Africa go into the Bullring needing to address their erratic batting. The hosts struggled against India in the Boxing Day test, failing to reach 200 runs in both innings. Skipper Temba Bavuma was the highest scorer in the match for the Proteas with 87 runs, while Dean Elgar managed 78. The bowling attack performed reasonably, with Lungi Ngidi completing a match haul of eight wickets, followed by Kagiso Rabada with seven. Mark Boucher’s charges lost the opening test by 113 runs. They'll be without the services of Quinton de Kock, who has called time on Test cricket with immediate effect. This after citing personal reasons for his retirement.
