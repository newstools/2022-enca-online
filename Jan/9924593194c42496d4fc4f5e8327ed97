He taught his daughter to ride at the age of three. eNCA's Siphokazi Malinga has more. Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - BMX, Cross Country and Enduro. When it comes to any form of biking, 12-year-old Tyla-May Smale does it all. The Northlands Primary school pupil has had a successful year, in her young career. She impressed across all three biking disciplines, but it was Enduro mountain biking that saw her being crowned KwaZulu-Natal and South African champion. Now her main aim is to inspire other young girls to take up the sport. * eNCA's Siphokazi Malinga reports.
