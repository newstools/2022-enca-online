AFP/Timothy A Clary LONDON - Emma Raducanu was named in Britain's New Year Honours list -- alongside a clutch of Olympic stars -- in recognition of her stunning breakthrough victory at the US Open. Cyclists Jason and Laura Kenny -- who have won 12 Olympic gold medals between them -- received a knighthood and damehood and there was recognition for Tokyo gold medallists Tom Daley, Adam Peaty and Max Whitlock. The honours list recognises outstanding achievements in various fields including showbusiness, sport and politics, as well as the contributions of people across society. A number of medical chiefs leading Britain's battle against coronavirus have also been given awards in the latest list. Raducanu, who became the first British woman to win a Grand Slam since Virginia Wade in 1977, has been made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). "It makes me immensely proud and grateful to be listed to receive an MBE from Her Majesty the Queen," said the now 19-year-old Raducanu, who did not drop a set at Flushing Meadows on her run to the title. "This year has been full of amazing surprises for me so to end 2021 with this appointment is very special."
