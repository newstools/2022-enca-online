Oil normally accounts for around nine percent of electricity generation on the island, but a Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) official said the company had run out of dollars to buy it from the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. The CEB was having to rely on its coal- and hydro-powered generating facilities and was applying rotating one-hour power cuts around the island, he said. He did not say how long the rationing would last but added that the 160-megawatt Sapugaskanda power station and a barge-mounted 60-megawatt generator at a Colombo port had been closed for an indefinite period. "The power cuts are being imposed because the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has not supplied us with fuel," the official said. Sri Lanka's acute foreign exchange shortage has already led to rationing of milk powder, sugar, cooking gas and cement. The island's tourism-dependent economy has been hammered by the pandemic and the government imposed a broad import ban in early 2020 to try to save foreign exchange reserves. The power cuts came as the country's energy minister warned of an impending petrol and diesel shortage within two weeks.
