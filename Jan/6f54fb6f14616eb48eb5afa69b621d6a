Unseeded former US Open finalist Keys fought back from a set down to end the hopes of teenager and third seed Coco Gauff 3-6, 6-2, 7-5. She will face Riske, who breezed through when 2021 French Open semi-finalist Tamara Zidansek withdrew with an abdominal injury as a precaution just days away from the opening Grand Slam of the year. "Coco's a phenomenal player and I knew I was going to have to play some of my best tennis," said Keys who is targeting her fifth WTA title and first since 2019. Keys and Riske are frequently practice partners and she knows it will need another big effort to get over the line on Saturday. "We both train with each other all the time, so it's going to be a really tough match. I'm just really happy to start the year off on a really great foot."
