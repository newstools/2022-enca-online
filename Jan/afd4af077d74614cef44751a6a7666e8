AFP/Ozan Kose ANKARA - Festive garlands, white tablecloths and enticing bottles appear the moment passengers board the Eastern Express for an epic journey across Turkey's snow-capped Euphrates plateaus. Named the Turistik Dogu Ekspresi locally, the train offers one of the expansive country's most coveted new experiences. Its nine carriages wind their way around mountain bends on a 32-hour, 1,300-kilometre voyage from the capital Ankara to Kars, an ancient city near Turkey's rugged border with Armenia and Georgia. "The Ankara-Kars line is considered by travel writers to be one of the four most beautiful train lines in the world," Turkish State Railways director Hasan Pezuk told AFP. - Three months of snow - The train runs twice a week from December 30 to March 31 to make the most of the snow-covered landscapes. Its route is a miniature version of Russia's Trans-Siberian railway, says engineer Fatih Yalcin. "There is always something to fix," he says, his head deep inside an electrical cabinet. "Last week it was minus 24 degrees Celsius ... The water was freezing," he says, adding that it sometimes falls to minus 40. "I intervene when required and without disturbing the passengers. Seeing them happy is a real pleasure for me." In the dining car, revellers can feast through the night under a nightclub-style mirror ball. Another faster and less festive train runs along the same route in around 20 hours, without the scenic stops. But this train was designed for the sheer joy of travelling through spectacular but hard-to-access provinces such as Kayseri, Sivas, Erzincan and Erzurum. And, of course, for partying through the night. As the evening turns to night, people begin meeting up in the corridor to share music and dance. The train brings together an array of Turkish society, with people of all ages and styles, from the reserved to the unrestrained.
