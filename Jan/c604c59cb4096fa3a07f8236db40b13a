#DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Lawyers acting for Zandile Mafe, who is accused of setting Parliament alight, are challenging a magistrate’s order committing him to Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital for observation. This after state prosecutors produced a document from a district surgeon which stated that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Mafe’s lawyers argue his committal to Valkenberg was unlawful and unconstitutional. They want him out of there, immediately.
