The Liverpool star smashed home his penalty with the Ivory Coast's Eric Bailly the only player to fail from the spot, and Egypt go on to play Morocco in the last eight in Yaounde on Sunday. It was a tense last-16 tie which for long spells resembled a battle of attrition on a poor pitch at the Japoma Stadium in Cameroon's economic capital, and it looked for much of the game as though Egypt would pay for their poor finishing. However, Carlos Queiroz's team are now through to the last eight despite having scored just two goals in their four matches in Cameroon so far. "Considering the number of opportunities we had I feel we deserved to win," said Queiroz, who said he is thriving under intense pressure despite criticism of the Portuguese coach in Egypt. "It is part of the package. Professional players and coaches can't live without pressure. It is a source of inspiration." Meanwhile, two-time champions the Ivory Coast are out, once again defeated by an Egyptian side who have long held the upper hand in meetings between the continental heavyweights. This was their 11th AFCON encounter and still Egypt have lost just once to the Elephants. Among their many successes against the Ivory Coast was their victory on penalties in the 2006 final, and a crushing triumph in the semi-finals in 2008. "I can't really reproach the players. It's not as though they missed every penalty. It was just decided by a little detail," said Ivorian coach Patrice Beaumelle.
