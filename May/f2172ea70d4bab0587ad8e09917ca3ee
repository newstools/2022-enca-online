We knew each other before we had kids, that's a 40-year-long friendship. "She has many friends and many more children. We only know of the two kids but she has more," she said. "Kids she helped to put through school. I once told her if only the media knew of the wonderful work you do." "We tend to focus on the negative. No one is perfect; we all have both positive and negative characteristics. If we want a good life, let's focus on the positive and tell that person while they are still alive."
