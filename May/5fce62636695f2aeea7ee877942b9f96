The 228.31-carat white diamond, larger than a golf ball, was sold for $18.8-million. AFP/Fabrice Coffrini GENEVA - The Rock, the biggest white diamond ever auctioned, sold for a hammer price of 18.6 million Swiss francs ($18.8-million) on Wednesday, far short of the record for such a jewel. The 228.31-carat stone, larger than a golf ball, was sold in Geneva by Christie's auction house. READ: 'The Rock' diamond goes under the hammer There had been high hopes that The Rock would smash the world record for a white diamond, which stands at at $33.7 million, fetched in the Swiss city in 2017 for a 163.41-carat gem. But the bidding, which started at 14 million francs, came to a halt after two minutes at 18.6 million, though the price will increase once taxes and the buyer's premium are added on. The pre-sale estimate had been 19-30 million Swiss francs. READ: 'The Rock' diamond dazzles in Geneva The Rock, a perfectly symmetrical pear-shaped diamond, was in the hands of an unnamed owner from North America. It was bought by a telephone bidder following the action at the Hotel des Bergues. Max Fawcett, head of the jewels department at Christie's auction house in Geneva, said there were only a handful of diamonds of similar size and quality to The Rock. The large diamond was extracted from a mine in South Africa in the early 2000s and has been shown in Dubai, Taipei and New York ahead of the sale in Geneva.
