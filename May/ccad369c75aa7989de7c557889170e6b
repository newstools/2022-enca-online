File: A netball court. JOHANNESBURG - The first leg of the Telkom Netball League was wrapped up on Monday. The Gauteng Jaguars easily overpowered the North West Flames, who had made a promising start. But the class of the Jaguars began to tell as they repeatedly opened up the Flames' defence. It would end 72 - 36 to the Gauteng outfit. Meanwhile, the Tornados ensured it would be a day of one-sided affairs. They easily disposed of the Diamonds in the clash of the Capes. It was the Western Cape side that enjoyed dominance over their Northern Cape counterparts. The Tornados eased to a 61 - 31 victory.
