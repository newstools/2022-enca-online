"We haven't received a report of people who are missing, besides the report the premier has made reference to of one person from Inanda who was discovered on our rivers. There were no other fatalities." "The treatment plant which is behind us has been severely affected. In the previous disaster in April, we put some remedial measures so that people will start receiving water so all those have been washed away." "Our teams will come back and reinstate some of the work that has been done before to ensure that people do access water. Many areas which have been affected, we have reinstated them...we are certain that by end of today, all areas will be covered in terms of those who were affected by the recent heavy rains."
