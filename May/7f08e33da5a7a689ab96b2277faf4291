The small Southeast Asian nation saw an 80 percent downturn in international traveller numbers in 2020 -- 4.7 million foreign tourists visited the previous year. From January travellers had been required to complete seven days of quarantine, present a negative Covid-19 test, and were limited to travelling within certain areas with officially sanctioned tour groups. Deputy Minister and Deputy Head of the Prime Minister's Office Thipphakone Chanthavongsa said on Saturday that a task force's recommendations that "measures for entering Laos PDR and relaxation for locals" had been approved.

The relaxed measures will see international checkpoints re-opened for Laotian citizens and foreigners, provided they are fully vaccinated. Unvaccinated visitors must produce a Rapid Antigen Test issued within 48 hours of leaving their origin country. Tourists will also have to pay for their own medical treatment should they become Covid-19 positive. Laos officials added that pubs and karaoke bars could reopen. The country has reported 663,533 coronavirus cases and 16,509 deaths.
