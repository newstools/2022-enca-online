Die Inkomstediens se voormalige ondersoekhoof sê dit gaan 'n leeftyd neem om die skade van staatskaping te herstel. JOHANNESBURG - A full blown wage strike at the South African Revenue Service is still set for Wednesday. The Public Servants Association confirmed to eNCA. READ: Threats to bring SARS to a standstill Nehawu and the Public Servants' Association will down tools at SARS over wages despite both parties saying talks are continuing. Both unions announced their intention to strike last week after a deadlock in wage discussions. SARS made a final offer of a zero-percent increase. Both unions are demanding increases of up to 13 percent, citing rising food and fuel prices. Nehawu -- which represents 45 percent of the workers, is threatening to bring SARS operations to a standstill. Services at customs operations at OR Tambo and land borders are set to be disrupted by the strike.
