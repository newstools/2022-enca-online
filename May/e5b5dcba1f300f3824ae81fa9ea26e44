But SIU head Andy Mothibi says it’s not yet at the point where it’s affecting the operation of the unit. He’s agreed with MPs who were interrogating the SIU’s annual plan that the funding model needs to be reviewed. Mothibi says the department of justice is drafting amendments to the legislation. “While SIU is in a sound financial position, we are a going concern, there are no risks but if we don’t recover this debt, it has got the potential down the loan, it will pose risks to the SIU operations.," he said. "There are some that pay. Towards the end of the financial year last we received significant amounts of around R200-million or so, there are those who pay, but there are big number that don’t pay.”
