It’s been a bumper long weekend in the Mother City with a reported influx of visitors making their way to the city for the extended three-day period. Tanya Nefdt reports. #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Workers’ Day long weekend has brought much-needed relief to the Western Cape tourism sector. The province experienced a surge in bookings. City officials say the welcoming rush was expected thanks to travel and accommodation forward bookings. At the same time, with KwaZulu-Natal still reeling from the floods, a travel intent study by Cape Town Tourism shows that 22 percent of holidaymakers who intended to travel to KZN, redirected their plans elsewhere in the country. * eNCA's Tanya Nefdt reports.
