Despite qualifying for the 2020 Women's T20 World Cup in Australia, cricket remains in its infancy in Thailand and is still virtually unknown. This in contrast to Asian powerhouses India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, where the game has deep historical roots going back to British imperial rule. Thailand missed out on the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand after the qualifying tournament was abandoned because of the pandemic. With further progress being hampered by minimal exposure on TV and lack of access to equipment, a small group of women are trying to build the sport in a country better known for its martial arts. Thailand made their international debut in 2007 but have drastically improved in the past three years, said their Indian head coach Harshal Pathak. "We like to play cricket with an aggressive brand... there's an intent in everything -- the way we bat, the way we field, the way we bowl. There's a businesslike attitude," he told AFP. "The girls want to make a mark for themselves." He praised the team's spin attack and said fielding was another strength, with batting slowly developing. "We're at a stage where we are mastering how to complete games and how to build innings," he said. - Additional reporting AFP
