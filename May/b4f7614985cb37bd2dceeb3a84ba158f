"This is a reflection of what is taking place in broader society. Today, if you talk to any young, black professional who is in the private sector, the second sentence will be to complain about racism at private-sector corporations. It's rife, and what is worse is that there is no longer an organised struggle to fight against that," he said. "I'm not saying we must leave the universities alone because this is a societal matter but it's broader than just the universities." He stated it is important to confront racism head-on and commended the university for taking swift action.
