The launch of the haulage solution, a hydrogen-powered, ultra-class mine haul truck is designed to operate fully laden with a payload of 290 tonnes in conventional mine conditions. This innovation is intended to contribute toward fulfilling part of that pledge. The President is expected to tour the mine before the formal proceedings commence.
