Friday Samu of Maritzburg United challenges Thato Lingwati of Royal AM FC during the DStv Premiership 2021/22 match at Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg. BackpagePix/Gerhard Duraan JOHANNESBURG - Zambian Friday Samu scored as lowly Maritzburg United upset Royal AM 1-0 to leave the race for second place in the South African Premiership wide open. Samu, a 26-year-old international forward who joined United in mid-2021, claimed his fourth league goal of the season by nodding a corner part Cameroonian goalkeeper Hugo Nyame on 22 minutes. It was a rare highlight in a dour duel as hosts Maritzburg reinforced a reputation for claiming prized scalps in the richest African football league, with a R15-million first prize. Success ended a five-match winless run by United, whose last victory came on March 5 against Mamelodi Sundowns, who have since clinched a record-extending fifth straight title. "We had a lot of energy tonight, and good game management in the closing stages," said veteran Maritzburg centre-back Clayton Daniels, who was voted man of the match. "It is great to have the fans back (after coronavirus-induced restrictions) and we always want to make them proud. They lift us so much. "Why do we perform so well against the top teams and struggle against lesser ones? I do not have an exact answer, but part of the reason may be that we play without fear against the big boys. "These three points will go a long way toward ensuring our survival after a challenging season. We are not safe yet, but are heading in the right direction." Royal remained second despite the loss, but are ahead of Cape Town City only on goal difference, with Kaizer Chiefs fourth, three points behind with three rounds remaining.
