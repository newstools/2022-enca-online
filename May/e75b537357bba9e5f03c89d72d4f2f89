South African President Cyril Ramaphosa Rodger Bosch/ AFP JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has commented on the urination incident at the University of Stellenbosch. READ: Lamola condemns alleged Stellenbosch racist incident Ramaphosa says racism is still a feature of everyday life in South Africa but he's encouraged by students who are protesting about what he calls a 'deep and pervasive problem in our society.' He's likened them to the youth activists of the 1976 Soweto Uprising. Ramaphosa wrote, "like the youth of 1976, a new generation of young South Africans is stepping forward to proclaim their birth right and reclaim their future. They are challenging society to grapple with racism, its causes and its effects." "As Ms Khumalo rightly said, it is not black people who are the problem and need attention, but those people who still hold on to ideas of white superiority." The President says honest dialogue is needed and should be included in the school curriculum. He's encouraged parents to also get involved and educate children from a young age. Ending racism is not just about changing attitudes; it is also about changing the material conditions that still today separate black and white South Africans. https://t.co/AviZmxQEXZ pic.twitter.com/QjBVEbtSiM
