AFP/Gianluigi Guercia CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court will re-hear alleged Parliament arsonist, Zandile Mafe's bail application, following a split decision. Now, a third judge has been appointed to be part of the hearing on 30 May. READ: Parliament Fire | Mafe bail application postponed In April, Judges James Lekhuleni and Daniel Thulare reserved judgment after they'd heard marathon arguments in the bail application appeal. Mafe is accused of starting the fire which gutted large parts of Parliament at the beginning of January. The 49-year old denies the charges. The trial was postponed to 9 June, as some forensic reports were still outstanding.
