Rafael Nadal has yet to drop a set through the first three rounds at Roland Garros PARIS - Rafael Nadal continued his pursuit of a 14th French Open title, cruising past Dutch 26th seed Botic van de Zandschulp 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to reach the last 16 on Friday. The 21-time major champion will play Canadian ninth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime for a place in the quarter-finals, where world number one Novak Djokovic could await him. Nadal is now 108-3 at Roland Garros in his career. "I think I played a good match against a good player. I'm very happy to win," said Nadal. The Spaniard had a break point for 5-0 in the third set, but Van de Zandschulp refused to roll over, winning four of the next five games before Nadal put away his second match point, having saved a break point in between the two. "You always feel a little bit the nerves to finish the match, so I'm happy to be through in straight sets," said Nadal. "I think it was my best match of the tournament so far for two-and-a-half sets, so I'm very happy with that." Nadal has reached at least the fourth round in 17 of 18 visits to Paris, with the exception of 2016 when he withdrew in the third round with a wrist injury.
