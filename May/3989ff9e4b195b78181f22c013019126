Courtesy of #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Langa railway residents will now be relocated in November this year. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says land has been secured through the housing development agency and processes will start soon. This as the first phase to reopen the central line, with limited services, is expected to commence in July. Just under R2-billion has been spent so far on infrastructure upgrades.

"But we still need to look at the distribution of our walling and the protection of our corridors more especially the hot spots in that area and that we still need to go through and check out exactly how we fund that based on the allocation we have. People who have illegally occupied Prasa owned-land say they’re disappointed by the move. They anticipated a July deadline for their relocation. Others have vowed to interrupt operations should the promises by the Minister not materialise.
