WATCH | eThekwini Chairperson Zandile Gumede to step aside She said, "We look to the national conference as a united voice. Nobody must undermine our unity. We must guard it. We don't want to become a joke again. We call for unity and sober heads, not just people hungry for power. "If we are confronted by challenges, you must also confront them as they are. Look at it right now, I've been elected as chairperson of eThekwini region in my absentia because I always say masses are not blind. "Even in absentia, if you are doing good, people will judge you. This issue of step-aside, I've honoured it because my leadership saw it fit to do it. But I'm telling you right now, things will change because if you know the truth, you don't worry, you just continue and do your work," she said.
