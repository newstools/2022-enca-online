Eskom has been implementing stage two blackouts at night this week and says not a single power station is fully operational. "Secondly, it is well understood among engineers who understand power stations, who understand boilers, who understand turbines that a lot of wrong things were done operationally speaking during a particular period in Eskom's history and that is what is now being fixed and that takes time," he said.

He says state-owned entities were greatly impacted by state capture at a time when Godi was chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Godi had blamed Eskom's failures on Gordhan and Eskom CEO, Andre de Ruyter.
