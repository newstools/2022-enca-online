Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe says Eskom has enough electricity in its reserves and he doesn't understand why the power utility is resorting to blackouts. Eskom has announced Stage 2 evening blackouts until Sunday. WATCH: Mantashe defends department's performance It is blaming ongoing generator breakdowns and sabotage. "I hear this 6,000MW but I know that Eskom is having 45,000MW connected capacity, it operates at 30,000MW, therefore, the shortfall of 15,000MW is on the sub-optimal operation of Eskom," Mantashe said. "As we implement the supplementary programme to boost generation, Eskom can also be optimised. They have 15,000MW that is idle."
