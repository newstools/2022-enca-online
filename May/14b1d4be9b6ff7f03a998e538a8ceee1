Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of Lisa Gherardini, known as the Mona Lisa or La Gioconda PARIS - The Mona Lisa was smeared with cake at the weekend by a man in a woman's wig who jumped out of a wheelchair and said artists should focus more on the planet. Officials at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where the enigmatic portrait holds pride of place, declined to comment on Monday on the bizarre incident, which was captured on several phones and posted on social media on Sunday. The treasured work by Leonardo da Vinci, which has been the target of vandalism attempts in the past, was unharmed thanks to its protective bulletproof glass case. A Twitter user identified as Lukeee posted a video showing a museum employee wiping what he says is cake off the glass and another showing a man dressed in white being escorted away by security guards. "A man dressed as an old lady jumps out of a wheelchair and attempted to smash the bulletproof glass of the Mona Lisa. Then proceeds to smear cake on the glass and throws roses everywhere, all before being tackled by security," Lukeee wrote. Speaking French, the man says: "There are people who are destroying the Earth... All artists, think about the Earth. That's why I did this. Think of the planet." No image have emerged showing the actual incident. The Mona Lisa has been behind glass since a Bolivian man threw a rock at the painting in December 1956, damaging her left elbow. In 2005, it was placed in a reinforced case that also controls temperature and humidity. In 2009, a Russian woman threw an empty teacup at the painting, which slightly scratched the case. The Louvre is the largest museum in the world, housing hundreds of thousands of works that attracted some 10-million visitors a year before the COVID-19 pandemic.
