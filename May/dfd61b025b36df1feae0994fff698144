Economists expect the Reserve Bank to hike the repo rate.
The bank is battling to contain rising inflation which currently stands at 5.9-percent.
Higher inflation forecasts support the case for the bank to raise interest rates.
Added to this global financial conditions are expected to tighten resulting in a weaker rand-dollar exchange rate.
