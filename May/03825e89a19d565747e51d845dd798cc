WATCH: Feeding the needy | NGO feeds over 90,000 Nearly a hundred pots of food will be cooked to feed 90,000 of the Western Cape's less fortunate. The tradition started in 1984 when three friends saw that many people in Athlone didn't have food for the celebration at the end of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting. The ingredients to feed the large number of people include 4.5-tons of meat, almost four-tons of rice, three tons of onions and 60,000-pieces of wood. One of the organisers sheds more light on the initiative. Nakhlistan's Fatima Allie said, "what you see behind us is a well-oiled machine. We have 96 pots of food cooking at the same time so because of COVID we had to split up the cooking of our food." "We used to cook 179 pots simultaneously but then we had to have social distancing, we had to space out the rows, so what you see behind me is 96 pots of food... everywhere you look around you see people cooking food is because of what Mowzer started 38 years ago. The gift that keeps on giving and in Islam we call it...Jaria."
