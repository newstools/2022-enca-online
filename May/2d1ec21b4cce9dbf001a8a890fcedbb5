A Japanese school has been landed with a hefty water bill after a teacher left a tap for a pool running in the hope of preventing Covid infections. AFP/Franck Fife JOHANNESBURG - Large parts of Johannesburg may experience water shortages. A City Power substation caught fire in Eikenhof, resulting in a power outage at the Eikenhoff Pump station which services large parts of the city. Johannesburg Water says they have started throttling water supply and will switch off reservoirs once water levels are too low. Assessments will be conducted after the substation has been declared safe by City Power. Affected areas include Roodepoort, Randburg and Soweto. Water tankers will be placed in strategic spots for public use.
