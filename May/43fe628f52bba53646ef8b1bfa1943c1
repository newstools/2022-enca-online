PIETERMARITZBURG - The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government Departments are tabling departmental budgets in the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature which are expected to respond to the recent flood-related disaster. The budget votes will give a clear indication of the magnitude and resources required to rebuild the province following the recent devastating floods, the effects of COVID-19 and the July unrest. The focus will be on the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs and the Department of Human Settlements and Public Works.
