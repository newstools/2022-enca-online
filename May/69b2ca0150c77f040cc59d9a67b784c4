That's a stern warning from angry protestors who submitted a memorandum of demands on Wednesday.   Mtwa was shot and killed last month when she drove up to her home. Many believe her ex-boyfriend Major Bhekizulu who's an ANC member and businessman, was allegedly involved. They are calling on the police to act swiftly.
