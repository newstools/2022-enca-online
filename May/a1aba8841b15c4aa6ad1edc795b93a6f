It's a race against time for police to find the killers of Hillary Gardee, the daughter of EFF's former secretary-general Godrich Gardee. She will be buried this weekend. #DStv403 MBOMBELA - The Gardee family says it's lost faith in the police after they failed to discover the bullet wound on her head. Family spokesperson Sinawo Thambo briefed the media a little earlier, saying they hope the police will redeem themselves by at least finding the killers.

"We've communicated already that it has dented our faith in the policing system, that they can miss such a critical thing at a crime scene. "That crime scene no longer adds value anymore because they missed a crucial part of it. We'll be waiting for updates from them.
