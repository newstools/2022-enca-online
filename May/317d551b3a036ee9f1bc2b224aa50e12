He says the separation of powers doctrine applies, as he was only suspended from his party's activities. READ: DA suspends Western Cape speaker amid fraud investigation Mnqasela's suspension followed findings by the party's federal legal commission on allegations relating to travel and entertainment allowances. He denies those charges. Mnqasela said, "I will not comment on the merits or the demerits of the litany of allegations against me. I've been saying they're baseless and I will not be found guilty subject to the allegations themselves." "I welcome the decision from the DA political party activities. None of my responsibilities are affected. The doctrine of separation of powers is therefore observed and should be at all times respected."
