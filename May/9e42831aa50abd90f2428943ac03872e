Aston Villa midfielder Philippe Coutinho LONDON - Aston Villa completed the permanent signing of Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho on Thursday in a deal the La Liga club said is worth 20 million euros (£17 million). The Brazilian has impressed since arriving at Villa on loan in January after struggling to make an impact at Barcelona. Barca confirmed the transfer includes a 50 percent sell-on clause if Coutinho leaves Villa. The former Liverpool star, who has scored four times and contributed three assists for Villa, has agreed a contract that runs until 2026. "This is a brilliant signing for Aston Villa," Villa boss Steven Gerrard told the club's website. "Phil is a model professional and his impact on the group has been very clear since he joined in January."
