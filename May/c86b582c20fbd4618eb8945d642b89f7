When the teachers tried to separate them some boys entered into the fray and there was chaos in the school," KZN Education HOD Nathi Ngcobo said. "On Thursday again, the fights started and the principal then advised the parents to come and take their kids home. "When the parents came, the parents of one of the girls assaulted the other girl and there was chaos again and the police came and it resulted in what you saw. The involvement of private security, we're not sure how they got involved."
