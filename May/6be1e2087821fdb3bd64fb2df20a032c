He says three days is simply not enough time to deal with matters of concern. READ: ANC Eastern Cape conference extended The ninth provincial elective conference has been extended due to the issue of credentials. Some branches claim the process of selecting a new chairperson is being manipulated. Mabe said, "we always have to make sure that the adoption of credentials must be thorough. We must prove to delegates that we've paid regard to all disputes." "Nasrec conference made sure there are sufficient platforms to attend to matters of concerns. Even in this conference there are members of MDRC to attend to issues that need cleaning or further resolution." "Not possible that a three-day conference will deal with all matters. [The] expectation that we must emerge with an economic charter of EC in three days is not enough."
