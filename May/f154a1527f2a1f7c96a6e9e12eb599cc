Environmental activist Rob Greenfield walks around Beverly Hills wearing a suit filled with every piece of trash he has generated living and consuming like a typical American for one month to raise awareness about how much garbage just one person generates. AFP/Robyn Beck BEVERLY HILLS - Rob Greenfield is proud of his rubbish fashion sense. The green campaigner has been walking around Los Angeles in a special suit containing all the trash he has produced in the last month. When AFP caught up with him in swanky Beverly Hills, he was wearing 28kg of wrappers and cans just from the drinks and meals he had consumed. Greenfield, who previously lived for a year only on food he grew himself, said the plastic pollution message was getting through. The sight of a man wearing garbage as he wanders through upmarket parts of one of America's most avowedly consumerist cities raises some eyebrows, but, he says, most people are interested in learning more. "There are some people who think I’m someone who’s experiencing homelessness or that I have a mental health issue, but for the most part, people have just been very positive. "People can understand this message and it helps me to really reach people from all walks of life."
