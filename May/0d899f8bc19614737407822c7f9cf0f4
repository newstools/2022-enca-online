Swedish director Ruben Ostlund is giving audiences 'something to talk about'. AFP/Christophe Simon CANENS - A viciously sharp satire about class conflict won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday, the second time Swedish director Ruben Ostlund has won the prize. "Triangle of Sadness" puts Ostlund among a select group of two-time winners of the top prize at Cannes. He first scooped the Palme in 2017 for "The Square". Now firmly established as cinema's king of cringe, Ostlund takes a scalpel to bourgeois niceties. This time he turned his gaze on fashion models and the ultra-rich, who find their status suddenly undermined when disaster strikes a cruise ship. Accepting the award, Ostlund said he wanted audiences to be entertained but also "to ask themselves questions, to go out after the screening and have something to talk about". - 'Come a long way' - The most moving part of the ceremony was the best actress award that went to Iranian Zar Amir Ebrahimi, forced to flee her country 16 years ago following a smear campaign over her love life. She played a journalist in "Holy Spider", tracking a man who murders prostitutes in the holy city of Mashhad. "I have come a long way to be on this stage tonight," said Ebrahimi, who now lives in Paris. "It was not an easy story. "This film is about women, it's about their bodies -- everything that is impossible to show in Iran," she added.
