"So far, we've been able to do a common cause investigation and that was concluded in January." "We've also been able to complete the technical assessments in terms of recovering the damaged property and that has been done and that has enabled us to be able to approach the market," he said. "In this case, we've been given permission to use the service of the original equipment manufacturer and they'll be helping us to recover unit number 4. "In terms of the consequence management emanating from the common cause investigations... employees that were involved in terms of management or actual operations during the event, those employees are being taken through the disciplinary processes the outcome will be made known once the process is completed, which we anticipate to be end of this month."
