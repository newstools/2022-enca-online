Kodikara COLOMBO - Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was booed and heckled Sunday on his first public outing since protests erupted across the country demanding his ruling family resign over the worsening economic crisis. Months of blackouts and acute shortages of food, fuel and medicines have caused widespread suffering across the South Asian island, which is enduring its worst-ever economic downturn. Sunday saw the premier, brother of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, visited one of the holiest Buddhist temples -- housing a reputedly 23-century-old tree -- in Anuradhapura. But dozens of men and women carried hand-written placards and chanted slogans demanding that "thieves" be banned from the sacred city, which lies 200 kilometres north of Colombo. "We will worship you if you stand down (as Prime Minister) and leave," one man shouted. Heavily armed Special Task Force (STF) commandos were deployed while police moved to clear the road for Rajapaksa's convoy of six vehicles. Officials said the premier would return to the capital by helicopter. Several major roads in the country are blocked by people protesting the lack of cooking gas, petrol and diesel. The defence ministry in a statement said demonstrators were behaving in a "provocative and threatening manner" and disrupting essential services. The government imposed a state of emergency granting the military sweeping powers to arrest and detain people on Friday, after trade unions brought the country to a virtual standstill in a bid to pressure President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down. The president, 72, has not been seen in public since tens of thousands attempted to storm his private residence in Colombo on March 31. Since April 9, thousands have been camping in front of his office in Colombo.
