READ: Mabe defends ANC EC conference extension Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said the party will not allow a repeat of the mayhem that ensued at the party's national conference in 2017. She said, "what if they demand the conference must not proceed, no one is allowed and that demand will not be adhered to. "We're here for the conference....no delegate will pick up a chair." "We've tightened security, but we're not saying people should not raise concerns, just like now people are singing, we're politicians. We've seen all the anarchy in the world, and we've dealt with it just like it 2017, we did not allow the conference to collapse, it proceeded." "Majority of delegates allowed us to continue, we'll do the same here....conference is not of us individuals, but branches...only the court can halt the conference because we respect the court."
