READ: Covid-19 in SA | Experts say fifth wave has begun "Do we call this a wave or do we just call it a resurgence of infections and everybody is moving towards let's just look at resurgence of infections because it is going to take a while to say, do we then use the same criteria that we used for the last four waves to say when we reach about 30% of previous infections then that is a wave or when we see the number of infections per 100 000," she said Koleka Mlisana from the National Health Laboratory Services.
