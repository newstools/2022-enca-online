AFP/Anthony Wallace JEJU - As footballer Cristiano Ronaldo will tell you, fan statues are rarely that flattering. But a life-size bronze of late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury in South Korea has his bandmates in rhapsodies. Mercury was a megastar there, with nearly a fifth of the population paying to see his biopic "Bohemian Rhapsody". Fans overcame protests that they were "honouring a homosexual" to put the statue up on the island of Jeju. Queen guitarist Brian May says he's sure Freddie would have been ga-ga about it. "I know he'd be happy," he said.
