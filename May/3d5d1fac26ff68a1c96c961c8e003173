The Salt River Muslim congregation has been a home for many throughout the years and, according to leaders, they’ve never received complaints until now. Religious leaders here say recently updated SOPs by the City of Cape Town have left them confused as places of worship and churches were exempt from the noise nuisance by-law. eNCA’s Nobesuthu Hejana fills us in. #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - The Human Rights Commission says the issuing of a noise nuisance notice to the Salt River Mosque by the City of Cape Town was insensitive and wrong. Church leaders say they’re still baffled by this act and are demanding answers from local officials. Meanwhile, the city plans to engage with the Mosque over the issue and promises to train staff on how to enforce updated procedures.
