Crowd-pleasing Fiji (November 12) will be the other opposition sandwiched in between the Springboks (November 5) and Wallabies (November 19) clashes after the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) announced the schedule on Thursday. The Irish -- who have a three-Test series in New Zealand in July -- will play South Africa in the pool stage on September 23 at the Stade de France in the World Cup. The two sides have not met since Ireland recorded a record 38-3 victory against the 'Boks in 2017, but South Africa have since gone on to claim a third Rugby World Cup title and a gritty series win over the British and Irish Lions last year. Ireland have not faced the Australians since clinching a three-Test series with a 20-16 victory in Sydney -- 2016 is the last time Australia were in Dublin as Ireland held on to post a 27-24 victory. Fiji were last in Dublin in 2017 when Ireland secured a hard-fought 23-20 victory. The Irish -- who finished second in the Six Nations this year losing only to Grand Slam achieving France -- have yet to progress beyond the quarter-finals in the World Cup.
