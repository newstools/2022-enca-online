Defence lawyer Malesela Teffo JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says the manner in which Advocate Malesela Teffo was arrested is an assault on both the court's dignity and the judiciary. Teffo was arrested in a Pretoria courtroom while representing four of the accused in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial. Teffo is facing contempt of court charges after failing to appear in a separate case earlier this year.
