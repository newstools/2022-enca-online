AFP/Jason Redmond LOS ANGELES - The Seattle Sounders defeated Mexico's Pumas UNAM 5-2 on aggregate to win the CONCACAF Champions League on Wednesday, ending Major League Soccer's 23-year wait to lift the top club tournament for teams from North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Two goals from Peruvian international Raul Ruidiaz and a late strike from Uruguayan veteran Nicolas Lodeiro sealed a deserved 3-0 second leg victory in front of a tournament record crowd of 68,741 at Seattle's Lumen Field. Last week's first leg had ended in a 2-2 draw in Mexico City. The Sounders' victory ends 16 years of unbroken dominance by Mexican sides in the regional club tournament. No MLS club had been crowned champions of CONCACAF since Los Angeles Galaxy lifted the title in 2000. Ruidiaz struck in the 45th and 80th minutes before Lodeiro lashed in a rebound in the 88th minute to spark wild celebrations amongst Seattle's passionate supporters. The title means Seattle will also become the first MLS side to advance to FIFA's Club World Cup tournament. "It means everything," Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei said after the win. "It's a Wednesday and we're packing this place with 68,000 people. The passion is so strong in this city. I'm so happy for everybody that we're able to achieve this for them. "In the end, it's all about winning trophies. We want to win trophies, and today's a big one."
