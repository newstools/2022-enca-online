Buddhist devotees visit the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon. AFP YANGON - Myanmar's junta will allow tourists to apply for visas after a break of more than two years, sparking calls by an activist group for foreign travellers to stay away. The country closed its borders to visitors in March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in an attempt to prevent infections rising. It was further isolated after the army toppled the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, prompting huge protests and a bloody military crackdown on dissent. "With an aim to develop the tourism sector... e-Visa (Tourist) applications will be allowed and accepted from 15 May 2022," said a notice in the Global New Light of Myanmar. It did not give details on when the first visitors could be expected to arrive. Activist groups warn that the military's vested interests in swathes of the economy -- including mines, banks, petroleum, agriculture and tourism -- mean tourist dollars will likely end up in the junta's coffers. Commercial flights for business travellers resumed in April, with visitors required to take a Covid-19 test on arrival but no longer required to quarantine. More than 1,800 people have been killed by security forces and over 13,000 arrested since the coup, according to a local monitoring group.
