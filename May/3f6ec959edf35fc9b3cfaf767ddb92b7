Many had crossed continents and had bought tickets for multiple nights. "I've been a fan since 1975," said one woman, Roxanne Dixon, who wore sparkly "A" and "B" earrings, a gold-trimmed white satin tunic and gold boots. "I came from Australia just for this."

The concert show at a purpose-built 3,000-seat theatre features digital avatars, or "ABBAtars" performing hits from the 1970s and 1980s as well as songs released last year when the septuagenarian former bandmates announced they had reunited to record a new album. The ambitious show is a hugely expensive project, with The Times reporting that ABBA need to recoup £140-million to cover costs. Band member Bjorn Ulvaeus told AFP ahead of the premiere: "I know that this is one of the most daring projects that anyone has done in the music industry, ever." Concert-goers see a 90-minute show, with a dozen live musicians on stage backing up the avatars.

The avatars are the product of a years-long project, designed in partnership with a special effects company founded by "Star Wars" creator George Lucas. Critics praised them after previous shows "resurrecting" dead performers have been slammed as unrealistic and creepy. This time, there was "nothing ghoulish", wrote The Times. The Guardian said the digital effects were a "triumph" and "the effect is genuinely jaw-dropping".
