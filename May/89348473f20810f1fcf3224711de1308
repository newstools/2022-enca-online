AFP/Markus Schreiber KYIV - Ukrainian former world boxing heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko says the International Olympic Committee should ban all Russian athletes following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Global sports governing bodies made the decision to suspend Russian and Belarusian athletes since the invasion began in February. The IOC, meanwhile, suggested that the athletes should not take part in international competitions or rather compete under a neutral flag.
