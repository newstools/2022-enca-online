South Africa's electricity crisis continues to be front and centre of everyone's minds. Many people just want an end to the rolling blackouts. eNCA reporter Heidi Giokos had a one-on-one sit-down with Eskom's CEO, Andre De Ruyter about issues facing the power utility. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom CEO, André de Ruyter, says it will take more time to turn around years of mismanagement and corruption at the embattled power utility. De Ruyter also says that he'll happily resign but only if the utility's board asks him to.

De Ruyter said, "don't expect me to turn this ship around that's been mismanaged for the past 15 years longer than that when we've had load shedding... for the past 15 years, an organisation that's been hollowed out by corruption." "To fight against corruption with one hand tied behind my back because we don't get the support from both law enforcement and prosecuting authorities..." "I would be the first guy to say I'll merrily step back if I feel I'm not making a dent in it or if there is someone else who can do a better job but that person hasn't stepped forward." "There are many armchair critics who style themselves as energy experts but, with respect, I don't think they have the full appreciation of the challenge the job entails." "If the board thinks I'm no longer doing a good job then it's up to them to fire me and I'm more than happy to go. I'm definitely not in the job for the money."
