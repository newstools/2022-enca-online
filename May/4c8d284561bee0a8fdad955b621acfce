Shoprite  JOHANNESBURG - The Competition Commission and Shoprite have come to a settlement over its ticketing business Computicket. Computicket distributes tickets for, among others, entertainment events, bus rides, and flights. Computicket has now agreed to pay a fine of just over R11m to settle a second prosecution against it by the Commission for alleged abuse of dominance. The ticket dispensing company was found to have entered into exclusive agreements with the majority of its product providers between 2013 and 2018. This resulted in Computicket's competitors being excluded from the market.
