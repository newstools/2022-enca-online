Courtesy #DStv403 GQEBERHA - The African National Congress says the organisation can’t be divided by conferences as some members of the Eastern Cape say they are approaching the courts to attempt to interdict the conference. READ: Some ANC members interdict EC conference They are claiming that branches in certain areas registered despite an April court order preventing this. The party's National Chairperson Gwede Mantashe says when people contest, it's not because they are enemies but because it's the democratic right of the ANC. He was speaking at the Eastern Cape elective conference on Saturday. Mantashe said, "comrades, we belong together. We must rebuild the ANC together. We must develop the content of the ANC together. We cannot be divided by conferences…If conferences cause infightings that means every five years we must fight, what kind of organisation is that?" "Here in the province after four years we have conferences. We can’t’ fight every four years. Beyond the conferences we must be in the ANC together. It doesn’t start beyond the ANC. When we contest each other, it is allowed in the ANC but when we contest we are not enemies of one another."
