TikTok has become wildly popular around the world in recent years. AFP/Wakil Kohsar ISLAMABAD - A Pakistani social media star with millions of followers is facing criticism after posing for a TikTok video by a forest fire as a devastating heatwave causes widespread misery in the country. Humaira Asghar posted a clip of herself walking playfully in a silver ball gown in front of a burning hillside with the caption: "Fire erupts wherever I am." It comes after police arrested a man earlier this month in the northwestern city of Abbottabad for intentionally starting a forest fire as a background for a video. Temperatures have peaked at 51 degrees Celsius in parts of Pakistan in recent days, leaving the poor and vulnerable struggling to beat the heat in the impoverished country. Asghar, who has more than 11 million followers on TikTok, said in a statement released by an assistant that she did not start the fire and there was "no harm in making videos".

"She should have been holding a bucket of water to extinguish the fire instead of glamorising it," Rina Saeed Khan Satti, an environmental activist and chairperson of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, told AFP. The group said at least one other blaze this week in the hills surrounding the Pakistani capital was started for a social media video. "The message these videos is sending is too risky and it needs to be contained," Satti said. One comment under Asghar's video on TikTok said her actions were "sheer ignorance and madness".
