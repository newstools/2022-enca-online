World number one Iga Swiatek. AFP/Tiziana Fabi PARIS - World number one Iga Swiatek said Friday she was prepared for her 28-match winning streak to be snapped at the French Open, where she will attempt to lift the trophy for the second time. The 20-year-old has won the last five tournaments she has entered, triumphing on clay in Stuttgart and Rome, and arrives in Paris as the overwhelming favourite for the title. "I'm aware that this streak is something that may be coming to an end soon, so I don't want to be like heartbroken when it's going to happen," said Swiatek. "I think being aware of that is pretty healthy." "I haven't played a Grand Slam since the streak started. So I guess we're going to see if everything I have been doing before is going to be enough. But I have really positive thoughts," she added. Swiatek became Poland's first Grand Slam singles champion when she won at Roland Garros in 2020, a tournament that was delayed until September-October because of the pandemic. Her title defence ended in a quarter-final defeat by Greece's Maria Sakkari last year, but she returns with more belief and self-assuredness after filling the vacuum left by the shock retirement of Ashleigh Barty. "I'm more relaxed," said Swiatek, who made the last four of the Australian Open in January. "I proved to myself and to other people that I can be in the top of the game, and before I wasn't feeling that much confidence, so this year I feel much more peace."
