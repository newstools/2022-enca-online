File: Damian de Allende. BackpagePix/Christiaan Kotze MUNSTER - Hard-running Springbok centre Damian de Allende has been ruled out of Saturday's clash between Munster and Leinster. De Allende is one of several injuries to hit the Irish team. He suffered a knock on the chest. His teammate, winger Simon Zebo, is also out because of a rib injury. Munster captain Peter O' Mahoney and fullback Mike Haley are both doubtful starters for the Irish derby. It's not yet clear how serious De Allende's injury is, but he should be fit for the rest of the URC. Bok fans will also be hoping he's back in shape for the Springbok series against Wales in July.
