Coal supplies more than two-thirds of India's energy needs and the country has baulked at the cost of transitioning to renewables -- even as unseasonably hot weather illustrates the threat from climate change caused by burning fossil fuels. Soaring temperatures have prompted higher energy demand in recent weeks and left India facing a 25 million tonne shortfall at a time when coal spot prices have skyrocketed since the start of the year. "We've always believed that coal is a much-maligned sector," coal ministry official Anil Kumar Jain said at an industry event. "Earlier we were hailed as bad boys because we were promoting fossil fuel and now we are in the news (because) we are not supplying enough of it." The government plans to lease more than 100 dormant state-owned coal mines to private miners on a revenue-sharing basis. Officials said they will "cut out the red tape" to encourage bids from mining giants Vedanta, Adani and others. India needs a billion tonnes of coal to meet domestic demand each year. Most of its needs are met by domestic producers, with a record 777 million tonnes of coal mined in the year to the end of March. The government says it plans to increase domestic coal production to 1.2 billion tonnes in the next two years to support the country's post-pandemic economic recovery. "We are very happy that the economy is on the rebound and power is being demanded. The malls are full, restaurants are full," Jain said.
