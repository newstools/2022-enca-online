A star is born: Spain's Carlos Alcaraz PARIS - At just 19, Carlos Alcaraz is bidding to become only the eighth teenager to win a Grand Slam men's singles title at the French Open which gets underway at Roland Garros on Sunday. AFP Sport looks at the seven men to have won majors while still in their teens:  BJORN BORG -- In 1974, Sweden's reluctant superstar Borg won the first of his six French Opens having just passed his 18th birthday when he defeated Manuel Orantes 2-6, 6-7, 6-0, 6-1, 6-1. Borg would win 11 majors, including five in a row at Wimbledon from 1976-1980 before retiring -- for the first time -- at 26. Borg was the first male tennis player to earn a million dollars in a season in 1979. "It's tough when you're No. 1. You don't have any private life, you can't even walk anywhere. I think that was one reason why I lost my motivation to play tennis," said Borg when he quit.  MATS WILANDER -- At 17, Sweden's Wilander defeated Guillermo Vilas of Argentina 1-6, 7-6, 6-0, 6-4 in a marathon four hours and 42 minutes French Open final in 1982 despite being unseeded. Wilander was widely hailed for his sportsmanship in his defeat of Jose Luis Clerc in the semi-finals when he requested a replay of match point after a forehand from his opponent was called long. Wilander would eventually become a world number one, ending his career with seven Grand Slam titles.  BORIS BECKER -- Becker burst on the scene with his maiden Wimbledon triumph in 1985 at the age of 17. His 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 win over Kevin Curren made him the tournament's youngest men's champion and its first unseeded victor. The German served and volleyed and dived right and left, enchanting the Centre Court crowd. Becker would win six majors but he fell from grace last month when he was jailed in the UK after a bankruptcy trial.  STEFAN EDBERG Experts: Stefan Edberg with Roger Federer in 2015 -- Sweden's Edberg was 19 when he won his first Slam at the 1985 Australian Open, beating Wilander 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 having seen off Ivan Lendl in a marathon semi-final 6-7, 7-5, 6-1, 4-6, 9-7. The elegant serve-and-volleyer won a second Australian Open in 1987 and also captured four more Slams at Wimbledon in 1988 and 1990 and at the US Open in 1991 and 1992.  MICHAEL CHANG -- Chang became the youngest male player in history to win a Grand Slam tournament when he claimed the 1989 French Open at 17 years and three months. Chang defeated Edberg 6-1, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 having also knocked out world number one Lendl in a 4-hour and 37-minute last 16 tie in which he was cramping and forced to serve underarm. He was the first American champion in Paris since Tony Trabert in 1955. The diminutive Chang was also runner-up at the 1996 Australian and US Opens.  PETE SAMPRAS -- Just a month past his 19th birthday, 'Pistol Pete' won the first of his 14 Slams at the 1990 US Open, beating American compatriot Andre Agassi 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 in the New York final having seen off Lendl and John McEnroe in the previous two rounds. Sampras ended his career with 64 titles, with a majors haul made up of seven at Wimbledon, two at the Australian Open and five US Open triumphs. His last major was in New York in 2002, bringing the curtain down with another victory against Agassi.  RAFAEL NADAL First of 13 titles in Paris for Rafael Nadal in 2005 -- At 19, Nadal defeated Mariano Puerta in the 2005 French Open final, 6–7, 6–3, 6–1, 7–5. It was his first major title and the first of a record 13 Roland Garros triumphs. The Spaniard, who now has 21 majors, won on his Paris debut, the first man to do so since Wilander in 1982. He was also the youngest champion since Chang in 1989. Interestingly, 2005 also saw the French Open debut of Novak Djokovic who made the second round where he retired against Guillermo Coria. Nadal was the last teenage man to win a Slam -- a feat which eluded his great rivals Djokovic and Federer.
