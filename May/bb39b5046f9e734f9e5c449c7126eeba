The union's Secretary-General Zwelinzima Vavi says the consistent rolling blackouts are costing the country's already stagnant economy. "When we speak about the economy that it is not just on stagnation but an economy that is being driven out by Eskom and by a government that refuses to take action against an obviously failing executive and board of Eskom," he said.
