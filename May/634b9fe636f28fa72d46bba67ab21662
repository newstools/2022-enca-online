READ: Dept of Water and Sanitation warned about paying suppliers Chairperson of the portfolio committee Robert Mashego said: “This is a matter dating back from 2012. It is taking a bit long. "Employees at senior levels have delaying tactics when it comes to them appearing before a disciplinary committee. Some of them would book off sick when they have to appear. It is very slow. "We’re demanding reports and following up on a lot of things. One minister was given an intention to suspend letter. We want to follow up with the minister to find out what has happened.”
