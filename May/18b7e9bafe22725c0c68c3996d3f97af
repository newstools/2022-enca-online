Pixabay/jarmoluk CAIRO - Egyptian giants Al Ahly have complained to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over CAF's decision to hold this season's Champions League final in Morocco. Choosing the city of Casablanca as a venue has caused fury online. That's because one of the main contenders, Wydad, is based in the Moroccan city. This means the club could have an effective home advantage if they get past the semi-finals. CAF president Patrice Motsepe was reportedly upset about being the last person to be informed. Ahly will face ES Setif in the two-legged Champions League semi-finals, while Wydad will take on Petro Luanda, who sent Mamelodi Sundowns packing.
