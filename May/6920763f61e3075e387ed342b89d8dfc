Former ANC KZN deputy chairperson Michael Mabuyakhulu JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Pietermaritzburg has dismissed an application by former MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu and his corruption co-accused. The application was brought due to alleged unreasonable delays by the state in the criminal trial. Mabuyakhulu and 15 others face charges of corruption, theft, and money laundering amounting to R28-million. The money was meant to host the North Sea Jazz Festival in 2012. That's when Mabuyakhulu was still KwaZulu-Natal economic development and tourism  MEC. While the festival never happened, the money was allegedly paid to service providers. The proceedings have been adjourned to 3 October.
