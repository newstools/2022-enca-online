WATCH: Discussion | R350 grant recipients must re-apply Beneficiaries of the R350 grant will now have to use supermarkets or ATMs to access the funds.

READ: SA Post Office to no longer pay R350 grants at branches Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said: "It will definitely affect those in deep rural areas. What we're saying is people must make maximum use of infrastructure available. They don't necessarily have to get their R350s from the Post Office. "In any case, those in remote places would go to the Post Office which is in town. We're saying please use supermarkets, Pick 'n Pay... We're saying while we're trying to make sure there's a plan in place, we bring services closer to them."
