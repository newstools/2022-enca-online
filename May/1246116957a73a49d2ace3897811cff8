AFP/Anna Zieminski JOHANNESBURG - Former Proteas cricketer Paul Adams won't be testifying at Mark Boucher’s upcoming disciplinary hearing relating to the Social Justice and Nation Building hearings. Cricket South Africa has appointed Senior Counsel, Advocate Terry Motau, to chair the disciplinary hearing into Boucher's conduct.

He was criticised for calling Adams a derogatory term as part of a team song when the pair were on the SA side in the late 1990s. Adams says he did not go to the SJN with malice but to honestly speak out about his experiences over the years in the national team.
