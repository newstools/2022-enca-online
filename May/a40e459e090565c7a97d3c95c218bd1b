Afriforum private prosecutions unit head and a legal presentative of the Meyiwa family, Adv. Gerrie Nel speaks to #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Advocate Gerrie Nel says Major General Johan Ndlovu's death will not have much impact on the prosecution as he was never on the witness list. Ndlovu was one of the first police detectives on the scene back in 2014 when Senzo Meyiwa was murdered. Nel, who represents the Meyiwa family in the case, says the state did not even receive a statement from him before his passing. READ: Teffo believes Maj. Gen Ndlovu's death is not natural "There were discussions and news articles, we don't even know if General Ndlovu was the first person on the scene," he said. "There might have been other police officers on the scene, he was on the scene but if he was crucial then certainly the investigating team would have included his statement. He was head of the detectives at the time of the commission of the offense, certainly, he would have ensured that his statement, if it was crucial, was in the case docket and it's not." Ndlovu passed away on Wednesday and the cause of death has not been published.
