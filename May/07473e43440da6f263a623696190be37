READ: KZN battered by more rain Premier Sihle Zikalala said they are working on fixing the roads and infrastructure that were further damaged. Zikalala said, "we have seen the damage is huge. The first is infrastructure or roads: M4 which was already closed due to the fact that the previous floods that took place in April affected the bridge." "The road got affected, severely damaged between La Mercy and Seatides. It is impossible to use that road for today." "We are working to ensure that we fill that gap or that hole that was eroded. We'll fill it and ensure by the end of the day or tomorrow, that road is reopened but you also know that that road will need to be tarred again and that will take place in due course. The department will work, continue to work on that."
