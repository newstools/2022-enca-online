READ: City Power updates progress on Eldorado Park substation Eldorado Park and surrounding areas have not had power for weeks and authorities says they’re not ruling out acts of sabotage. “Since the 15th of April, we discovered that more than 20km of cables were stolen. We now find about 170 fuses being stolen in the area. These are not your ordinary cable thieves, it’s organised crime," Sun said. "We will not rule out an element of sabotage. We have two groupings of residents. One group that supports our technicians and another group of criminals in the area who will take the opportunity to attack our technicians.”
