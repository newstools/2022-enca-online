A female director at one of the companies listed on London's FTSE 100 index earns an average £237,000 per year compared to £875,900 earned by male counterparts, according to a study. AFP/Chris Young LONDON - Europe's stock markets fell at the open on Friday in a global selloff rooted in worries over rising interest rates and surging inflation. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index dropped 0.5 percent to 7,467.66 points, one day after the Bank of England hiked interest rates to a 13-year peak and highlighted UK recession risks. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX index shed 0.8 percent to 13,793.22 points and the Paris CAC 40 lost 1.2 percent to 6,293.10. Asian equities tumbled Friday after steep Wall Street losses, as traders contemplated a period of fierce monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve. Global markets have been battered this year by a series of crises including surging inflation, rising interest rates, China's economic slowdown and the war in Ukraine. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lifted borrowing costs 50 basis points -- the most since 2000 -- but held off on signalling more aggressive measures.
