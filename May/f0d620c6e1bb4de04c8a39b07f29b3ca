Courtesy of #DStv403 EAST LONDON - ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe is adamant there is no crisis that could potentially collapse the party's Eastern Cape elective conference. He says the extension is to ensure fair processes. The 9th elective conference will now conclude on Monday, instead of Sunday. He said, "we're in conference, an elective one so we're expecting that when it rise it would conclude what it was convened for, which is only to renew the mandate of the leadership that would have emerge. The reason we take time is to make sure the outcome is welcomed by everyone." "You have to make sure you address all concerns. Delegates are happy, we shouldn't imagine a crisis where non exists. If ANC decides to extend days of conference, it will produce what it was convened for....in this province"
