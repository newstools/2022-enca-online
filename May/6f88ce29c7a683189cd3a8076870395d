One suspect has been arrested while investigations continue. Gardee said, "I am told the gruesome story of your death. I now turn to those who killed you. More than 100 have been kidnapped and released or loved to release themselves." "Their silence and the silence of their close friends killed you. Those hundreds and their friends who knew and came before you failed to report or do follow up on this crime of abduction to use captives ATM cards and their pin codes." "Their silence and the silence of the community and incompetence of police with active dockets of hundreds of similar incidences killed you my dear. The cry the loudest, they are cowards, you have been killed by the silence of the country against this new crime." "Everyone was silent until this gruesome death and only now many of them are coming out. The criminals have got nowhere to hide."
