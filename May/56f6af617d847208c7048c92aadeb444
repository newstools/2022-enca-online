Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan responded to comments made by former Scopa chairperson, Themba Godi. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has been too slow to find solutions to power cuts that have become a norm in recent years. And we will continue to live through the pain and unpredictability at least for the foreseeable future. That's according to Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan.

"We said until we get these extra megawatts into the system, and in my view as I’ve said already that process has been far too slow, to actually help the current environment in which we find ourselves, we will have to together live through a bit of pain and uncertainty. "But I think we hear the SA public loud and clear that we will like to see loadshedding minimised in a very serious way, in a shortest possible time."
