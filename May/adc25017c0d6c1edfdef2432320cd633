Impressive run for Canada's Leylah Fernandez ROLAND GARROS - Teenager Leylah Fernandez reached the French Open quarter-finals for the first time on Sunday, revelling in her new nickname of "Clay-lah" in honour of her impressive run at Roland Garros. Fernandez clinched a tight 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 win over 2019 semi-finalist Amanda Anisimova of the United States to make the last-eight. On her way, the 19-year-old has broken serve 23 times over four rounds leading to her rebranded first name by national media. "I think it's actually pretty amazing that they came up with Clay-lah, because I have no creativity for that. I wouldn't think of that nickname," said 17th-seeded Fernandez, the US Open runner-up last year. "But my family do use the nickname Leylannie, using my first and middle name, and they put it together, which I always like. I know that I'm doing things right or I'm like being a good kid when they're calling me Leylannie." Fernandez will face Martina Trevisan of Italy for a place in the semi-finals.
