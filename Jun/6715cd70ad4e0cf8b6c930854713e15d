The Australian defeated British wildcard Paul Jubb 3-6, 6-1, 7-5, 6-7 (3/7), 7-5 on the back of 30 aces and 67 winners. Kyrgios was unhappy with some fans on a packed and raucous Court Three and demanded they be removed from the stadium even as early as the first set. "There were a couple of people not shy of criticising me -- that one's for you," said the 27-year-old, ranked 40th in the world. "You know who you are." Kyrgios, who stunned Rafael Nadal on his way to the quarter-finals at the All England Club in 2014, arrived at the tournament after semi-final runs in grass-court events in Stuttgart and Halle. However, he was out of sorts in the first set. As well as his displeasure with a section of the crowd, he also called a line judge "a snitch with no fans". "The crowd was pretty rowdy," said Kyrgios. "He was a local wildcard with nothing to lose. But it was a lot of fun."
