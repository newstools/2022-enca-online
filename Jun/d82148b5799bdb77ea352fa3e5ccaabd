South Africa's Lloyd Harris returns a forehand to Chile's Christian Garin during their first round match of the Men's Italian Open at Foro Italico in Rome, Italy. AFP/Filippo Monteforte JOHANNESBURG - Lloyd Harris' 2022 season has come to an end. South Africa's tennis ace underwent wrist surgery and will now spend the rest of the year recovering. The 25-year-old Harris has been involved in 21 matches this season and has managed a 7-14 win-loss record. His best performance this year was at the Miami Open where he reached the fourth round. Upon his return in 2023, the world number 36 will be hoping to have as good a season as last year's when he won 33 matches, reached a career-high 31st on the rankings and went as far as the quarter-finals in the US Open, his highest placing at a Grand Slam.
