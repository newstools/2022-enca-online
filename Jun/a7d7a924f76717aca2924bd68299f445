#eNCA #DStv403  CAPE TOWN - Khayelitsha youth say they are sad and scared. Their lack of opportunities and alternatives mean they're often the perpetrators of crime in the sprawling Cape Town township. Three of the police stations falling within this area are among the top 30 with the highest levels of crime in the country. On Thursday the community sought to take back its streets and to thrash out the problems at a crime summit. eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger has the details in the video above.
