A woman invaded the court during the final at the ATP tournament in Halle on Sunday HALLE - A protestor briefly held up play in the men's ATP final at the Halle tournament Sunday between world number one Daniil Medvedev and Hubert Hurkacz. The woman wearing a t-shirt bearing the German text "Only Three Years Left" sprinted onto the court before security guards eventually escorted her away. A similar thing happened at the French Open at the start of the month when a protestor ran onto the court and tied herself to the net in the semi-final between Casper Ruud and Marin Cilic.
