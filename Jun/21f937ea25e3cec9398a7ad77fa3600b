Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer says the power utility is trying to conserve diesel and avert a total blackout. The country is currently on Stage 2. READ: Stage 2 blackouts until Sunday Eskom was giving an update on the current system challenges earlier on Wednesday. “Unfortunately we are at a point where we have to conserve both the pump storage dam levels and low diesel levels and utilise generation resources to contain load-shedding to a Stage 2 over the evening peak periods," Oberholzer said. "However, should we continue to experience breakdowns in the fleet of the coal fire power stations, this may, unfortunately, escalate to a Stage 3 or even higher. This is what we are trying to avoid that’s why we needed to implement Stage 2 this morning.”
