Coco Gauff returns the ball to Martina Trevisan during their women's semi-final singles match. AFP/Thomas Samson PARIS - Coco Gauff has reached her first-ever Grand Slam final after seeing off Italian Martina Trevisan at Roland Garros. The American teenager completed a straight-sets victory to end a Cinderella run for unseeded Trevisan. Gauff -- who turned 18 in March -- is the youngest player to reach the French Open decider since Kim Clijsters in 2001. She is also the youngest finalist at any Grand Slam since 17-year-old Maria Sharapova secured the Wimbledon title back 18 years ago. Gauff will now take on in-form World number 1 Iga Swiatek who is on a 34-match unbeaten streak.
