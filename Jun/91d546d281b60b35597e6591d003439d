US President Joe Biden falls off his bicycle while approaching well-wishers during a bike ride near his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. AFP/Saul Loeb REHOBOTH BEACH - US President Joe Biden took a tumble as he was riding his bicycle near his beach home in the state of Delaware Saturday morning, but was unhurt. A video from a White House pool report showed the 79-year-old president immediately getting up after his fall. He then says: "I'm good." He was biking with First Lady Jill Biden in a state park near their beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and had stopped to talk to onlookers when he fell. The president told a small crowd of well-wishers and reporters that he had lost his balance as he tried to pull a foot out of a bike clip. The result: "a mad scramble of Secret Service and press," a White House pool report said, adding there were no visible scrapes or bruises from the fall. "No medical attention is needed," a White House official said. "The President looks forward to spending the rest of the day with his family." Videos posted to social media later in the afternoon showed the president seeking to prove his agility. Reporters and onlookers called out as Biden left a church service, asking if had suffered any injuries from his spill. Biden didn't answer but took three quick hops and raised his fists in a demonstration of strength. As the oldest US president, Biden's health is the subject of constant attention, particularly as speculation rises on whether he will seek a second term in 2024. In November 2020, shortly after his election but before taking office, Biden broke a foot while playing with his pet German shepherds. But a year later, in November 2021, his doctor gave Biden a clean bill of health, describing him as "healthy" and "vigorous."
