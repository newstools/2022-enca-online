Enoch Nkwe is Cricket South Africa's new director of cricket. AFP/Sajjad Hussain JOHANNESBURG - Cricket South Africa announced Enoch Nkwe as the new director of cricket, replacing Graeme Smith. Nkwe will take up the new role from Friday after Smith chose not to renew his contract back in March. In August last year, Nkwe quit his post as assistant to Proteas coach Mark Boucher, citing differences over team culture. In what can only be described as a plot twist, his new job description means he will now be Boucher's boss. The 39-year-old beat former Proteas all-rounder and current Warriors coach Robin Peterson to the post. Nkwe is currently the Strategic Cricket Consultant at the Highveld Lions. He has vast experience in the world of cricket having coached the Lions to the T20 Challenge and the Four-Day Sunfoil series back in 2019. He also served as interim Director of the Proteas for the tour of India in the same year. Cricket South Africa (CSA) is pleased to announce the appointment of four successful candidates who will form part of the organization’s dynamic Executive team.
