While they will be in Saturday's URC final, their Currie Cup team fell in the semis. Griquas stormed Loftus on Friday. The visitors breached the Bulls' defence on three occasions in the second half. Those tries gave the Bulls too much to do to get back in the game. The hosts gave themselves hope when Bernard van der Linde pulled a try back. But all that was undone when a late penalty try secured the win for the Griquas. It ended 30 - 19 to the men from Kimberley. Griquas will face the Cheetahs or the Pumas in the final.
