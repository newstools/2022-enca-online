Transit visas are issued to foreigners who pass through South Africa  enroute to neighboring countries. Motsoaledi was speaking following the arrest of Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals attempting to enter the country illegally this week. He said, "we're going to demand transit visas, if you transit here to eSwatini we must understand. Even if they were not caught here, they were going to continue to  eSwatini. They go to eSwatini and come back through our porous borders." "We have border management now. We are deciding in Home Affairs to reinstate the transit visas. You saw on social media when they were pulling people off pipes in the ceiling, that passage is for pipes and wires and all that."
