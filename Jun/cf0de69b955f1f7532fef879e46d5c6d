"Any society that does not take of its youth, does not deserve its future. The future of the youth depends on us as society. This is a societal challenge that we must overcome. It is societal challenge that we must address," Pakati said. READ: Authorities rule out stampede as cause of tavern tragedy "The lady from social development that was speaking here was spot on. "We have a big challenge, but in order for us to be able to address it we need to acknowledge that there is a substance abuse problem amongst young people, of course they won’t at all times behave like adults but the ability to nurture them accordingly still resides with us as adults. "For society not to face extinction it has to reproduce itself. Now we have lost 21 young people, and that equates to losing the next generation," the mayor said. "Some of them would have contributed to the development of the same society that we speak off. Society is therefore robbed of its future by the departure of these children."
