File: The Constitutional Court. eNCA/Govan Whittles JOHANNESBURG - The Chief Justice’s probe into the Ismail Abramjee SMS saga has revealed that none of the Constitutional Court workers had knowledge of the Mkhwebane judgment. Raymond Zondo appointed retired President of the Supreme Court of Appeal, Justice Lex Mpati to investigate allegations of the leaked information. This followed a complaint by suspended Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane. READ: Ramaphosa suspends Mkhwebane She said Abramjee indicated he had it on good authority that the Constitutional Court had decided to dismiss her rescission application. Abramjee's text message led to the last-minute postponement of an urgent application in the Western Cape High Court to put the brakes on impeachment proceedings in parliament, and to interdict Mkhwebane’s possible suspension by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Mpati has since concluded his investigation and found that messages from Abramjee do not constitute evidence that Justice Jody Kollapen had been passing on information to Abramjee.
