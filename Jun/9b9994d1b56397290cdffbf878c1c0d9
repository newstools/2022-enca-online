The industry body says thousands of people will lose their jobs. READ: Tiger Brands | Food producer exits Nigeria Tiger Brands says it may close the plant after its sale to a prospective buyer fell through, but Agri SA says the company's focus should be on finding new buyers. "It's important to remember that this one of two factories that produce canning food on a very large scale, it doesn't only produce food for SA, but the rest of the world. A large part of the world depends on canned food due to the war in Ukraine whilst there's a demand for the product, we're arguing that there's no sense in closing down the factory, let us find buyers," Agri SA's executive director Christo van der Rheede said. "I've been on a phone with potential buyers the whole day. AgriSA would like to see that that factory is taken over by new investors and keep jobs, and create more jobs opportunities for the locals."
