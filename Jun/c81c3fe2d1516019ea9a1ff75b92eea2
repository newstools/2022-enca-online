The Boks are preparing for their first Test series of the year against Wales which is just a month away. The preparation camp will include players from three franchises including the Stormers, Sharks, and Bulls, who are in the last eight of the United Rugby Championship. Coach Jacques Nienaber has opted to announce his team later in June at the end of the URC season. The available players will participate in training sessions over the next three weeks.
