AFP/Philip Fong TOKYO - Japan stepped up their preparations for next year's Rugby World Cup with a 34-15 win over Uruguay in Tokyo on Saturday. The 2019 World Cup hosts were kicking off a series of home Test matches that will see them play Uruguay twice and Six Nations champions France twice over the coming weeks. Japan fielded a mix of up-and-coming players and veterans of their historic run to the 2019 World Cup quarter-finals and had too much firepower for Uruguay. First-half tries from Koga Nezuka and Tevita Tatafu put them in control before Kosuke Horikoshi, Koji Iino and Takeshi Hino all scored after the break. Diego Magno and Manuel Ardao scored second-half tries for Uruguay. Japan camped out on the Uruguay line until they broke the deadlock in the 10th minute when left winger Nezuka found himself in acres of space to touch down in the corner. Yu Tamura kicked a penalty to increase Japan's lead but Uruguay held firm and reduced the arrears with a penalty from the boot of Felipe Etcheverry. Japan went into the interval in a more comfortable position after number eight Tatafu broke through the Uruguay defence to touch down in the last action of the first half. Horikoshi burst through to score another one minutes after the restart, but Magno kept things interesting for Uruguay when he crashed over with 20 minutes remaining. Iino removed all doubt when he scored Japan's fourth try in the 64th minute, before Hino added another and Ardao grabbed one for Uruguay. Japan have been drawn to face England, Argentina, Samoa and a qualifier from the Americas at the World Cup. Uruguay will play hosts France, New Zealand, Italy and an African qualifier.
