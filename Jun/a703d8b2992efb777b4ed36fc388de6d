Monkeypox is a virus transmitted to humans from animals. There's been an outbreak of the virus in various countries around the world. South Africa's monkeypox patient zero is a 30-year-old man from Johannesburg. "I received a report from the National Health Laboratory Services CEO that they have confirmed through laboratory tests the first case of monkeypox in South Africa," Phaahla said. "The patient is a 30-year-old male from Johannesburg who has no travel history, meaning that this cannot be attributed to having been acquired outside South Africa. Working with the relevant health authorities, a process of contact tracing has begun."
