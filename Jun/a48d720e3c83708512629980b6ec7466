Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The DA's Jack Bloom says the cancellation of surgical operations at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg could have easily been prevented. Gauteng Health MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi confirmed that 870 operations were cancelled at the hospital this year alone. She attributes this to broken laundry machines and infrastructure challenges.

"This is very simple to arrange. How come after so many years so many hospitals have had to cancel operations and patients go without clean linen? "So the MEC confirmed that laundry problems were behind a lot of cancellations, honestly the simple solution to buy from private laundries, we wouldn't have all this."
