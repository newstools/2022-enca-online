The limping railway system has left thousands of commuters struggling as there's little alternative. eNCA/Heidi Giokos JOHANNESBURG - Exxaro has flagged Transnet's rail network as a problem for its own operations. The company, which is one of Eskom's biggest coal suppliers, says inefficiencies along the rail network has negatively impacted its exports. In its latest operational export, sales volumes are expected to drop by 27 percent mainly due to lower rail performance at Leeuwpan and Belfast. Mpumalanga’s export rail performance also declined from 15 trains per week last year to eight trains so far this year. The rail performance is due to poor locomotive availability, derailments and instances of cable theft and vandalism. But Exxaro says it continues to speak to Transnet to find ways to improve the challenges. It's not all bad news as sales to Eskom are expected to increase by two percent.
