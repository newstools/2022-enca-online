Fuel prices have steadily climbed in Greece in recent months. AFP/Pascal Pochard-Casabianca ATHENS - Greece's state TV was mocked over a segment that showed viewers how to siphon gasoline from cars as fuel prices soar. "It's not something terribly complicated... you don't even need a special tube, even a hose for balconies will do," the station's reporter Costas Stamou said during ERT's morning news programme Syndeseis. After demonstrating the method, a car repairman then points out where a car's fuel tank can alternatively be pierced to steal the contents. "Are you guys in your right mind? Giving people tips on stealing gasoline?" commented one user on Twitter. "After the tutorial on two ways to easily steal gasoline, ERT is now preparing new how-to's on how to open locks and steal wallets," jibed another. A video mixed by Greek satirical website Luben had been viewed over 170,000 times by Thursday. Another 32,500 saw the original segment on Twitter. Fuel prices have steadily climbed in Greece in recent months, with simple unleaded at over 2.37 euros ($2.50) per litre on average in Athens on Wednesday, and over 2.50 euros on Rhodes and neighbouring islands. Greek authorities have resisted calls to cut tax on fuel, opting instead for 30-50 euro subsidies to less well-off car and motorcycle owners.
