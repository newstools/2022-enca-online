AFP/Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images TORONTO - Rory McIlroy registered his first PGA Tour victory in 2022, retaining the Canadian Open crown just a few days ahead of the US Open. McIlroy defended his title with a two-stroke after carding an eight-under-par 62, to win ahead of Tony Finau. Finau carded a six-under 64 that put him alone in second on 263, just one stroke in front of compatriot Justin Thomas. It's McIlroy’s 21st PGA Tour win of his career, pulling clear of Greg Norman's Tour title haul of 20. The Northern Ireland star McIlroy played in the PGA Tour event while a number of his colleagues competed at the Saudi-funded LIV Golf Series. The PGA Tour has suspended its members who played in the tournament.
