JOHANNESBURG - The Umbrella Men is set in the colourful and culture-rich Bo-Kaap (Cape Town), and beautifully captures the nuances of the community with humour, drama and of course some romance. Starring Jacques De Silva, Shamilla Miller, Rob van Vuuren, Bronte Snell (Atlantis), Keenan Arrison (also Atlantis), and Joey Rasdien, The Umbrella Men, is a feel good movie about a bunch of musician who are forced to rob a bank during the city’s Minstrel Carnival in an effort to save their nightclub. When musician Jerome Adams flies into Cape Town for his estranged father’s funeral, he finds his dad has bequeathed him his beloved Goema Club as well as the care of The Umbrella Men minstrel troupe. Unfortunately, the Club comes with a huge overdraft, due in two weeks for repayment to the bank on penalty of repossession, in a shady deal engineered by Tariq Cupido, a long-time family rival. Jerome decides to rob the bank during the annual carnival parade when thousands of troupes will invade the streets. Tariq’s troupe, The Maulers, will be competing against Jerome’s Umbrella Men. Will the ‘prodigal son’ be able to pull off the heist of the year and save his family’s business?
