PSA spokesperson Reuben Maleka says they’ve written to the president to reconsider the adjustments. "We are in the midst of the negotiation with the PSBC. READ: Wage negotiations | Parliamentarians paid less than international counterparts: spokesperson "We already received 3 percent as an increase that is what they are offering as government and we are saying 3 percent and there’s a new inflation that is around 6.4 percent so you can imagine, with the high rate of inflation, food inflation, the petrol that is expected to reach around R27 a litre," he said. "That is even way above the minimum wage which is R23, how could they expect that public servant will be able to cope? "So if we don’t get a resolution or even above inflation, that calls for public service shutdown."
