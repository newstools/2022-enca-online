They're upset over the latest racial abuse directed at him. On Monday, a video emerged of fomer F1 driver Nelson Piquet referring to the seven-time champion using the Brazilian slang for the N-word. Piquet used the slur while discussing last year’s British Grand Prix, where the Mercedes driver and Max Verstappen were involved in a crash. Most Twitter users noted Hamilton has constantly been a victim of racism during his career. Only a select few believe that enough is being done about racism in the sport.
