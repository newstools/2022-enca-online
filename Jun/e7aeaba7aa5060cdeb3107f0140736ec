Wing Jonny May is back in the England squad. AFP/Pool LONDON - Wings Jonny May and Jack Nowell were on Monday named in a 35-man England squad for a three-day training camp taking place this week as part of preparations for their tour of Australia. May made his comeback for Gloucester on Saturday, featuring as a second-half substitute after five months out recovering from a knee injury. Exeter star Nowell, who broke his arm during England's Six Nations defeat against France in March, also returned for his club during the final round of regular season Premiership action. There are first involvements in a senior England camp for Biyi Alo, Charlie Atkinson, Freddie Clarke, Sam Jeffries and Namibia-born Exeter prop Patrick Schickerling. Players from Premiership semi-finalists Leicester, Saracens, Harlequins and Northampton were not considered for selection. The list of uncapped players also includes Wasps back Paolo Odogwu and Bath centre Max Ojomoh, but there is no place for experienced Bristol prop Kyle Sinckler. Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie and Bath wing Anthony Watson will attend the camp in London to undertake rehab work as they continue to recover from injuries. England head coach Eddie Jones said: "With a number of players unavailable because of the Premiership semi-finals, we've got the opportunity to call up some new players. "It's a great opportunity to learn about them and see what potential they have to play a part in the Australia tour." England play three Tests against the Wallabies next month, starting in Perth on July 2.
