eNCA\Screenshot JOHANNESBURG - The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has ruled in favour of the South African Revenue Service (SARS) in its case with a freight company. Sars seized 19 containers from China in 2020, saying the goods had been under-declared on import. The containers, which included clothing items, were flagged by the revenue service's electronic risk engine designed to pick up fraud and illegal activities. READ: Threats to bring SARS to a standstill The SCA affirmed SARS's right to seize and detain the goods. The respondents in the case argued that SARS' decision must be set aside due to 'procedural unfairness and irrationality' but the SCA argued that SARS acted within its mandate.
