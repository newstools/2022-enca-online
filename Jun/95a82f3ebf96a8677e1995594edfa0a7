A study found that prolonged sitting or a sedentary lifestyle leads to higher risks of life-threatening diseases. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Sitting can kill you. This is the finding of a new global study. It found prolonged sitting or a sedentary lifestyle leads to higher risks of life-threatening diseases. It seems this is more prevalent in middle to low-income countries. "If you live in an area that's not conducive to you walking and you don't have a gym or a facility at home combined with the fact that you eat unhealthy foods... the combination of those factors is a huge risk," said Pamela Naidoo of the Heart and Stroke Foundation. "Because what then happens is it makes you more prone to poor health."
