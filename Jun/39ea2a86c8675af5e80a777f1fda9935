READ: NMB: Day Zero not with us yet The charity's Director, Imtiaz Sooliman, says it's vital for all stakeholders to work together to help delay day zero in the Eastern Cape. "We have to have the link between business and the municipality. This cannot be done alone, it has to be done with everyone together because its an emergency. "Boreholes were drilled in 2018, so maybe we can also help get those boreholes to work. We've received funding to start with more drilling for boreholes. We'll bring in more drills once the funding increases, and we can bring another four drilling on site."
