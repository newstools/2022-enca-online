Russia's Daria Kasatkina returns the ball to Russia's Veronika Kudermetova during their women's quarter-final singles match. AFP/Christophe Archambault PARIS - Russia might have been in the news for all the wrong reasons since the turn of the year after its invasion of Ukraine, but Daria Kasatkina is trying to change that. Kasatkina beat her compatriot Veronika Kudermetova to advance to her first-ever grand slam semi-final. The 25-year-old completed a straight-set victory at Roland Garros. Kasatkina will now face world number 1 Iga Swiatek, who extended her winning series to 33 matches as she beat Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals.
