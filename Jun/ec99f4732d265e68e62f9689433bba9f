The commission has raised concerns about the hospital's infrastructure. READ: Nearly 900 operations cancelled at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital "Our visit here seeks to examine the fiscal infrastructure, to test the correctness of reports that there are maintenance issues, equipment failures and shortage of linen," said the commission's Buang Jones. "We had a constructive interaction with the CEO of the hospital. We have agreed that they will provide the commission with a formal response next week. "There should be a broader engagement with the heads of the department of health infrastructure and the provincial treasury and the meeting will take place in the first half of July in order for us to unpack the issues and find solutions."
