File: AFP PHOTO PHILIPPE HUGUEN  JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has announced that it will implement Stage 4 power cuts from 11am until midnight on Friday. The utility says it's conserving emergency generation reserves. This is because some of its employees have embarked on unprotected strike action.
It follows a deadlock in wage negotiations. Eskom says roads have been blockaded and employees who continue to work, are being intimidated. It's appealing to unions to respect the law and desist from illegal conduct.  #POWERALERT1
