#eNCA #DStv403. JOHANNESBURG - Namibian President Hage Geingob is denying helping President Cyril Ramaphosa in the 'Farmgate' scandal. Geingob says the claims are outrageous and unfortunate.    Former intelligence boss Arthur Fraser claims Ramaphosa sought Geingob's help after millions were stolen from his Limpopo farm. Geingob says the suspect, a South African citizen, was arrested in June 2020 after entering the country illegally.
