The hosts headed into the encounter in Cuttack trailing 1-nil in a five-match T20 series. Batting first, India lost the wicket of opener Ruturaj Gaikwad who Keshav Maharaj caught off the bowling of Kagiso Rabada. Shreyas Iyer tried to rebuild the home team's innings before Dwayne Pretorius dismissed him for 40 runs. The home side would eventually reach 148 for the loss of six wickets in their 20 overs. In their run chase, the Proteas lost Reeza Hendricks, Dwaine Pretorius and Rassie van der Dussen early on. But Henrich Klaasen steadied the ship and went on to reach an impressive 81 runs before he was dismissed. However, it was too little too late as South Africa reached 149 runs for six with 10 balls remaining to secure a six-wicket victory.
