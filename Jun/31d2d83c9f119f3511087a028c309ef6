Mr Happy Face looks towards the camera before the start of the World's Ugliest Dog Competition in Petaluma, California. AFP/Josh Edelson LOS ANGELES - Every dog has its day. This was proven true for Mr Happy Face after he won the world's ugliest dog contest. This 17-year-old Chinese Crested dog defeated nine competitors in a decades-old event held annually in California. Never mind the aesthetics, his tuft of punk-style hair and a tongue sticking perennially out the side of his mouth might have played in the canine's favour. The champ was adopted from a shelter last year. He was a survivor of abuse and neglect. Mr Happy Face's hobbies include sleeping, snoring, woofing in his sleep and making odd sounds when he is happy.
