Buckingham Palace released a new photograph of the queen to mark her Platinum Jubilee. AFP/Buckingham Palace LONDON - Huge crowds converged on central London in bright sunshine on Thursday for the start of four days of public events to mark Queen Elizabeth II's historic Platinum Jubilee, in what could be the last major public event of her long reign. From early morning, a steady stream of people, many clutching Union flags and picnic baskets, headed to The Mall near Buckingham Palace, where the 96-year-old monarch will make two appearances later. But as well as seeing the pomp and pageantry of the Trooping the Colour military parade, many sensed the coming end of an era. The extent of the queen's involvement in the celebrations for her record-breaking 70 years on the throne has been a source of speculation for months. She has had to cut back drastically her public appearances since last year because of difficulties standing and walking -- and a bout of Covid. But royal officials confirmed that she would take the salute of mounted troops from the balcony. The centuries-old ceremony has previously seen the queen take the salute on horseback herself. Seventy years on, she is now the only monarch most Britons have ever known, becoming an enduring figurehead through often troubled times. Britain's first and very likely only Platinum Jubilee will see street parties, pop concerts and parades until Sunday. It has not yet been confirmed if she will attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday, while her planned attendance at horseracing showcase The Derby on Saturday is off. She could yet put in a final appearance -- again from the palace balcony -- on Sunday, at the climax of a huge public pageant involving 6,000 performers.
