File: A golf ball. LONDON - LIV golf players have been given the green light to take part in this year’s 150th Open Championship. The PGA Tour has since moved to bar players who have joined the Saudi-funded Series. Despite that ban, organisers of last week's US Open did not follow suit. Meanwhile, the European-based DP World Tour is expected to announce whether it will punish its rebels this Thursday. Brooks Koepka has announced he will be the latest player who is set to join the rebel series. The Open Championship starts at St Andrews in Scotland on 14 July.
