"I got there around midnight, it was already overcrowded and full.

In the middle of those pushing security to come in and out we were pressed and stuck. "Someone just closed door, maybe to try control people outside but he made it hard for everyone inside to breathe because there's no windows and only air is from the door. "So when you closed [the door] lots of people started collapsing so it was hard to breathe. Music was still playing. The pushing didn't stop and we were all getting dizzy and there was just someone who kept spraying pepper spray or something."
