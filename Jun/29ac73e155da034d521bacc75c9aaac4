 JOHANNESBURG - Political Party Al-Jama-ah says it will open a criminal case against, Joburg Mayor Mpho Phalatse and council speaker, Vasco Da Gama.
The party claims the two officials failed to act against the now embarrassed MMC for Economic Development Nkuli Mbundu.
However, Mbundu who spoke to eNCA exclusively says allegations of interference in procurement processes against him are cooked-up.
