READ: Eskom's wage offer to be presented to unions on Friday NUM's Livhuwani Mammburu said: “There’s a lot at play. Workers say they do not trust Eskom anymore. "Last year, Eskom signed a 1.5 percent hike without reaching agreement with unions. Also the apartheid wage gap, they emphasise that Eskom cannot be trusted. Those are some of the issues that are making workers angry.”
