File: SA Rugby’s Director of Rugby Rassie Erasmus. AFP/Odd Andersen  JOHANNESBURG - SA Rugby has confirmed its Director of Rugby's Twitter account has been hacked. Rassie Erasmus was left red-faced after a pornographic video was retweeted. SA Rugby says Erasmus is no longer in control of the account. The matter has been reported to Twitter and it's hoping for a speedy resolution. In the meantime, it's asked people to disregard any content on @RassieRugby. It says Erasmus has not been in control of the account since Friday. There have, however, been posts seemingly from Rassie Erasmus apologising for the Tweet and calling the hacker out.
