It follows similar warnings to consumers from retail giants Shoprite and Pick n Pay. Spar says it plans to expand promotions to continue to attract cash-strapped consumers. The group's half-year results to March shows solid growth, with wholesale turnover increasing by 7.7-percent. Spar's local liquor sales at TOPS jumped more than 40 percent as trading restrictions eased. The retailer says its new online shopping platform SPAR2U will be up and running in the coming months.
