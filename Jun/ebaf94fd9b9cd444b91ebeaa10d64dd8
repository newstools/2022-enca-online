JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers is denying that striking workers have reached a wage agreement with Eskom management. The union's national spokesperson, Livhuwani Mammburu, says consultations are ongoing and no agreement has been signed. Earlier, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan told a media briefing that a wage agreement had been reached with striking workers.

"The recovery of  Eskom plants and various things will be done and to get operations going will be done on that basis," Gordhan said. Mammburu said members still need to be consulted but he can confirm that there is an offer on the table. "We met with Eskom management ... today [Tuesday] the offer has been tabled.

The comments made by the Public Enterprises Minister that there is an agreement that has been reached with the unions is a reckless statement to be made," Mammburu said. "There's no agreement that has been reached. We're still going in the central bargaining forum where Eskom would present that offer. "After Eskom has presented that offer, we will take it back to our members who'll give us a mandate to whether they're accepting the offer or not." The country was plunged into Stage 6 power cuts blamed on the strike action. Eskom has reached a wage agreement with striking workers. That's according to Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan.
