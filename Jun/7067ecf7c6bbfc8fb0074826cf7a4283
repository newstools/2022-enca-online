Dutch police officers stand guard near the entrance of the TEFAF Art Fair in Maastricht following a robbery. AFP/ANP/Marcel van Hoorn MAASTRICHT - Flat-cap wearing armed robbers staged a brazen daylight raid on an international art fair in the Netherlands, smashing a jewellery case with a sledgehammer in front of terrified visitors. Police said they pulled over a car and arrested two Belgians in their twenties after the four smartly dressed thieves held up the TEFAF (The European Fine Art Fair) in the southern city of Maastricht. Dramatic social media images showed the robbers threatening people with what appeared to be handguns before running off with an undisclosed amount of what police called "loot". The venue was evacuated but visitors were eventually let back into the fair, which draws tens of thousands of people over several days. No one was hurt, police said. "A stall was raided, they fled and we started the search," Wim Coenen, a spokesman for Limburg province police, told AFP. "There were four suspects, two were arrested." Dutch media said the display case contained diamond jewellery and other items from London jeweller Symbolic and Chase. There was no comment from the firm. Police confirmed in a statement that "jewellery was stolen. Additional details about the loot are not being provided at this time." Dutch police launched a huge search involving a helicopter and sniffer dogs and arrested a 22-year-old and a 26-year-old man nearby, both from Belgium, shortly after. "These two persons were driving a gray vehicle with a Belgian registration number. This car was pulled over... Their possible involvement is still under investigation," it said. The TEFAF fair is one of the biggest in Europe and features hundreds of works, including a 17th-century drawing by a Dutch Old Master on sale for one million euros. A TEFAF spokesman added in a statement to AFP that its "security teams worked quickly to disarm an offender... Nobody was injured during the incident."
