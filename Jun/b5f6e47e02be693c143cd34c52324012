READ: Soweto residents protest over Eskom service delivery Pimville and Klipspruit communities are protesting against power cuts at Eskom's local office. "The infrastructure of Eskom is dilapidated. Our country started in 1994, everything that is Eskom infrastructure has never ever been replaced or renewed from the cables to infrastructure underground," Dlamini said. "So that’s the real reason while we sing this. Even if we win a small battle in Diepsloot, we move away and we hear a report that say the transformers has exploded again simply because the entire network of infrastructure has not been serviced properly.”
