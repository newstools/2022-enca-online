Courtesy of #DStv403 PARLIAMENT - In defence of a 3 percent wage hike for South Africa's Parliamentarians, spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says they are paid less than their international counterparts. Mothapo says public servants should be paid in a way that prevents them from taking on work outside the system. President Cyril Ramaphosa accepted recommendations to increase salaries.

And when you look at the fact that there are safeguards that these Members of Parliament in SA are operating under. "For instance, there is about 78 percent of Parliaments all over the world that are allowing their Parliamentarians to undertake work outside of Parliament, in South Africa that is not allowed," Mothapo said. "So, we need to appreciate that our members need to be paid decently and they need to be paid a just and defensible salary. "They need to be paid in a manner that there will be no temptation to undertake work outside or any kind of offers that might influence the work that they are doing.”
