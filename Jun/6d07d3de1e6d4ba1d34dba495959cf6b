In a Twitter post, the 15-time major championship winner says his “body needs more time to get stronger for major championship golf”. His most recent tournament was last month at the PGA Championship. Despite making the cut, he had to withdraw after labouring to a third-round 79, his worst round at a tournament he has won four times. The 46-year-old tweeted that he's still planning to play in the British Open at St Andrews, which starts on 14 July.
