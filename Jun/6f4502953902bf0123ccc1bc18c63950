Australians are up in arms about local KFC outlets' decision to use a cabbage mix on some menu items due to a lettuce shortage. AFP/William West MELBOURNE - Australia's prime minister joked he would huddle with top officials to discuss the soaring cost of lettuce and local KFCs' decision to replace the verdant leaf with a cabbage mix on their Zinger Burgers. Dubbing the fast-food chain's decision "crazy", centre-left leader Anthony Albanese quipped the situation had become a national "crisis". Lettuce prices have soared by as much as 300 percent in Australian cities thanks to recent flooding and high global fuel prices.

As a result, KFC told Australian customers it would reduce the lettuce in its products in favour of a 50-50 lettuce-cabbage mix. "Cabbage isn't the same as lettuce. That's just wrong," Albanese told Sydney's KIIS FM radio. "I'll put it on the list for the Cabinet meeting today. Cabbage-gate."
