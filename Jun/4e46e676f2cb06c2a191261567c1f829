It's also a build-up to the ICC T20 World Cup. South Africa will contest the 5-match series from Thursday facing a side resting some senior players. They include Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli among those resting. That leaves KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant to lead the team. South Africa will have a full-strength team with Temba Bavuma as captain. The hosts welcome all-rounder Hardik Pandya who returns after a brilliant season with IPL champions Gujarat Titans. Anrich Nortje is also back, while selectors roped in Tristan Stubbs.
