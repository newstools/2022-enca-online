Andy Murray has been forced to withdraw from Queen's. AFP/dpa/Bernd Weißbrod LONDON - Andy Murray has been forced to pull out of Queen's due to an abdominal injury, but remains hopeful of being fit enough to compete at Wimbledon later this month. The three-time Grand Slam champion underwent a scan on Monday which showed a strain to his left abdomen suffered in losing the final of the Stuttgart Open to Matteo Berrettini on Sunday. "After having a scan this afternoon, an abdominal injury means I won't be fit to compete at Queen's this year," said Murray, a five-time winner at the London event. "The tournament means a lot to me and it's disappointing not to compete, especially after playing some good matches on the grass already." Murray skipped the French Open to concentrate on the grass-court season with deep runs in Stuttgart and Surbiton a week earlier lifting him back into the world's top 50. Wimbledon begins on June 27.
