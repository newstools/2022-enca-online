Simona Halep hits a return on her way to the last 16 of the Australian Open with a 6-2, 6-1 demolition of Danka Kovinic. AFP/Martin Keep BERLIN - Simona Halep's Wimbledon hopes suffered a blow on Friday when she withdrew from the semi-finals of the WTA tournament in Bad Homburg with a neck injury. Halep, the 2019 Wimbledon champion, was forced out of the grass-court tournament in Germany on the eve of Wimbledon, which starts Monday. With Romania's Halep sidelined, her Canadian opponent Bianca Andreescu progresses to the Bad Homburg final on Saturday, the WTA said in a brief statement, where she will face either France's Alize Cornet or Caroline Garcia.
