The arrest of the Gupta brothers is being widely welcomed. But, it's not clear if and when they will face justice in South Africa. Many expect them to fight extradition at every turn. eNCA's Aviwe Mtila is watching developments. #DStv403 DUBAI - Two Indian-born businessmen brothers have been arrested and are facing extradition to South Africa where they were allegedly at the centre of a web of state corruption, Dubai police said. Atul and Rajesh Gupta are accused of paying bribes for state contracts and influence over ministerial appointments in a scandal that dogged former president Jacob Zuma's administration. "Dubai Police made the arrest after receiving a red notice for the Gupta brothers by Interpol," Dubai Police said in a statement. "The force has also coordinated with the authorities in South Africa regarding the extradition file to complete the legal procedures." The arrests came as a probe was concluded into massive plundering of state institutions during Zuma's nine-year administration until 2018. Red notices are a global alert enabling law enforcement to arrest a person sought for prosecution or to serve a custodial sentence and detain them pending extradition.
