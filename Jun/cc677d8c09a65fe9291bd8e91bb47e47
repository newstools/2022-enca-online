Delegates were made to stand in the freezing cold outside a plenary venue, as they were verified manually. This after concerns were raised that bogus delegates had made their way into the conference hall. Regional chairperson Stan Mathabatha is seeking re-election for a third term, and he’s up against Dickson Masemola.
