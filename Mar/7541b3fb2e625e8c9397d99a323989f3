They say they've been unable to cast their ballots in by-elections as their names were not on the voters' roll. The main opposition CCC, led by Nelson Chamisa, says its members were turned away deliberately. It blames this on the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. Zimbabweans have been voting for 133 vacant seats in parliament and councils. Results are expected on Sunday. * eNCA's Zimbabwe correspondent Pindai Dube reports.
