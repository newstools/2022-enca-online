Ulset made his Paralympic debut in Salt Lake City in 2002 and has since netted 13 medals including three gold competing in biathlon and cross-country skiing. On Friday, he'll race in his last event -- biathlon -- at the Beijing Winter Paralympics and is hoping to end his sporting career on the podium once more. "I'm hoping to put together a really good race and have fun out there," he told AFP in Zhangjiakou, outside the Chinese capital. Ulset won't be straying far from the competition sidelines -- he will continue working as a para-sports consultant for Norway's Olympic and Paralympic Committee. "Sport has given me so much... now I can try to give back," he said. He began skiing aged four and his older brother John -- who has competed at World Cup level in biathlon in able-bodied sport -- encouraged him to get involved in the sport. Ulset spent his childhood and youth competing against non-disabled athletes before he qualified for Norway's Paralympic team. Since his first foray into international events two decades ago, Ulset said he's witnessed a transformation in the professionalism and quality of para competition. Norway’s Nils Erik Ulset races towards the finish line at the men’s sprint standing biathlon event in Beijing "The big change there came around the (2010) Vancouver Games," he said. Ulset trains with many non-disabled athletes back in Norway and has watched para-sports push the boundaries. In the past two decades, some Norwegian Winter Paralympians have become household names. "From Sochi (2014 Games) until now, especially the last three or four years... the awareness has changed a lot, you now get recognised as a para-athlete," he said. "Before, no one knew you."
