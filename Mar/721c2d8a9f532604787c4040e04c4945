Over 3m young people are out of school, unemployed, and not in any form of vocational or skills training. These are youth who seem to have thrown in the towel, in a labour market that seems to have no capacity to absorb them. Ayesha Ismail has more. #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Youth unemployment is a ticking time-bomb according to Asanda Luwaca, chairperson of the National Youth Development Agency. This comes as overall unemployment reached an all-time high of 35.3-percent. READ: SA unemployment rate rises to 35.3% in Q4 of 2021 Luwaca said, "it really does paint a grim picture particularly for young people, we know that the country is really faced with the challenge of poor economic participation particularly amongst young people and what this really means is that it inhibits the countries economic development and imposes an even larger burden on the state to provide social assistance." "So when we have a state that has a youth bulge, but the large majority that particular cohort that is not economically active, that is not in education and training, it really becomes a problem and is ultimately a ticking time bomb."
