The Glasgow pair are joined in the group by uncapped clubmate Murphy Walker, a tighthead prop, while Jordan Edmunds, a rugby sevens specialist, has also been added. Kiran McDonald, Glen Young and Duhan van der Merwe have returned to their clubs. Scotland are fourth in the table after two wins and two defeats while Ireland, second behind Grand Slam-chasing France, still have a chance of being crowned champions.
