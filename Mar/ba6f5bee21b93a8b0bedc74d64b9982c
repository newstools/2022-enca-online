The Civil Aviation Authority says its findings into Comair operations show an immediate risk to safety and security. British Airways regional service and low-cost carrier Kulula remain grounded indefinitely. Both airlines are operated by Comair, who is in hot water with South Africa’s Civil Aviation Authority. Neither party will go into detail as to why, only that it pertains to safety and security risks. Passengers across the country have been left stranded. eNCA’s Lindsay Dentlinger is at the Cape Town International Airport and Heidi Giokos is at OR Tambo International Airport with the latest.
