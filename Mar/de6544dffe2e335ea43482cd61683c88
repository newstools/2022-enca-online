Sibusiso Sangweni of the Lions challenged by Jacques van Rooyen of the Bulls during a 2021 Carling Black Label Currie Cup match. BackpagePix/Muzi Ntombela JOHANNESBURG - The Lions take on Munster at Ellis Park in Saturday’s United Rugby Championship match minus captain Jaco Kriel. The 32-year-old injured his arm during the Lions 37-20 home victory over Cardiff last weekend. He will be replaced by Sibusiso Sangweni in the starting XV against the Irish outfit. That’s the only change in coach Ivan van Rooyen’s team, who are looking to build on the solid win over Cardiff. Kriel underwent surgery on his arm on Thursday, according to the Lions. This may result in an extended period on the sidelines.
