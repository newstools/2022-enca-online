The public health system in South Africa’s most populous province is in dire straits. Gauteng Health MEC Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi, the DA's Jack Bloom, and Action SA's Lincoln Machaba speak to #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The DA says Chris Hani Baragwanath isn't the only hospital experiencing food shortages. It made headlines when it emerged it had run out of food -- including bread -- for patients. Doctors were forced to bring lunch for patients at risk at the facility. The DA's Jack Bloom said Heidelberg Hospital had to go to another hospital to get supplies. WATCH: Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital staff protest budget cuts "Apparently, contracts expired and weren't renewed or extended. This is a basic staple. How can you not have bread in a hospital and why aren't patients getting proper nutritious meals?" he asked. "You know meat, fish, chicken, vegetables, fruit you know all in short supply. I was sent pictures by a patient at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital this week and I'm quite horrified they get a roll, a bit of margarine, dried vegetables. "You know you're sick, you're vulnerable, you need to get your strength back with decent nutritious food. I think the rot is very very deep seated. There are problems with management at various hospitals."
