AFP/Andrej Isakovic BELGRADE - American Grant Holloway equalled his own world indoor record in the semi-finals of the men's 60m hurdles in Belgrade. Holloway clocked 7.29 seconds to win the second of three semis, a time he previously set in Madrid in February last year. The 24-year-old American is a world 110m hurdles gold medallist, who also won silver at last summer's Tokyo Olympics. He advances to the final scheduled for 1825 GMT, although defending champion Andrew Pozzi of Britain missed the cut. Making up the final are Holloway's teammate Jarret Eaton, the French pair of Pascal Martinot-Lagarde and Wilhem Belocian, Serb-born Cypriot Milan Trajkovic, Spain's Asier Martinez and Australian Chris Douglas. Spot number eight went to Briton David King following an unprecedented tiebreak after he finished his semi with exactly the same time, to the thousandth of a second, as Japan's Shusei Nomoto. Nomoto was left in shock after watching track officials draw King's folded bib out of a black bag rather than his own to confirm the Briton's participation.
