Mshengu has warned that anyone found disrupting schooling or interrupting the work of the panel will be dealt with by the law. "We won't allow anyone to undermine the legs of state because disrupting a school is undermining the state, and challenging the state," Mshengu said. "We are going to act with the police as you can see we are here now. We are going to have a clear plan with MEC for Community Safety in the province to say, we want anyone or any parent who will see action upon by the police decisively that is the message we are communicating because ultimately these learners must be able to perform, they must cover the curriculum."
