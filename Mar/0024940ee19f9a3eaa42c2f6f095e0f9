DA's Shadow Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Cilliers Brink, says while the ruling party is not obliged to hold its members to account, those who are in government don't have a choice. "The third installment of the Zondo report makes it clear that the ANC is a compromised organisation. It is fundamentally corrupt and in this particular instance we can't trust the integrity commission of the ANC because there is no integrity in the ANC."
