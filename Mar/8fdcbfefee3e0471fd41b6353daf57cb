AFP/Alejandro Pagni BUENOS AIRES - Argentina and the IMF said they had reached an agreement on a "pragmatic and realistic" plan for the country to repay a ruinous $44-billion debt. The economy ministry in Buenos Aires announced that a deal was struck on refinancing its debt in a way that "seeks to continue generating conditions of stability." The deal -- the details of which were ironed out between Argentine officials and IMF staff after an in-principle agreement in January -- will be sent to Congress later Thursday for approval. It must also be ratified by the international lender's executive board.

The country received $44-billion of that amount. Macri's successor Alberto Fernandez refused to accept the rest, seeking also to renegotiate repayment terms. Payments of $19-billion and $20-billion were due this year -- a timeline the government considered impossible. Argentina is just emerging from three years of economic recession and battling rising inflation and a high poverty rate. Under the new deal, the ministry said, repayments will be made from 2026 to 2034 after a grace period. In this way, Argentina hopes to reduce its fiscal deficit from 3.0 percent of GDP today to 0.9 percent by 2024.
