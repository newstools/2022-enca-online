March marks world water month, and some South Africans still experience day to day problems with various water challenges. What can be done to address these problems? To help us unpack this, we're joined now by Director General of the Water & Sanitation Department, Sean Phillips. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa doesn't have a water crisis, but there is scarcity according to the Water and Sanitation Department's Director General, Sean Phillips. He says risk assessments indicate that water might limit economic development in future. DISCUSSION | Gauteng water disruptions slammed Phillips said, "it's a mixed picture, overall we're not in a water crisis, we are water scarce country." "We do run risks that especially with climate change, drought." "Water might become a constraint to economic development in South Africa. As a country, we all need to use water much more sparingly. Municipalities need to reduce water leaks." "The second challenge that we have is that there's still some communities who don't get supplied with water. The third key problem is that water infrastructure at municipality level is not being maintained."
