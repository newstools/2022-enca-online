AFP/Stringer JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has defended South Africa's decision to abstain from a UN vote on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Pretoria has been criticised for not voting with other world leaders, demanding that Russia withdraw its military from Ukraine. In his weekly newsletter, Ramaphosa says the UN resolution didn't call for meaningful negotiations and engagement. He says South Africa is firmly on the side of peace.
