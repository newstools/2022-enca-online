Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has revealed that Prasa has been scammed by 3,000 ghost workers. He says the agency discovered this through its operation called Ziveze last December. Prasa has since halted their salaries, but no one has come forward to say they haven't been paid. WATCH | SA's Rail Network | Scopa's oversight visit to Prasa Mbalula was answering questions before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. He said: "The 3,000 that have been found is part of ongoing process what Prasa called operation 'Ziveze'... and that operation has proven, by last year December 3,000 people who have been paid... and since December their salaries have been stopped. "None of those people have come forward to claim that they've been stopped unfairly, meaning it's a system of corruption within human resources. Someone has orchestrated the scam to steal money from the organisation, that's how broken Prasa is... in a normal organisation you can't have one ghost worker, you have 3,000."
