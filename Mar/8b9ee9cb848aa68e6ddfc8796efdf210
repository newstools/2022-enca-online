The National Football Supporters Association has threatened to protest in almost all the upcoming domestic matches. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs have completed a league double over their bitter rivals Orlando Pirates. Amakhosi drew first blood through a Reeve Frosler scorcher to take the lead at the interval. However, the Buccaneers asked all the questions in the second half and were rewarded when Kwame Peprah also scored his first derby goal from a sweeping move. But it was Stuart Baxter's side that would have the final say as Eric Mathoho towered above everybody else to head home nine minutes from time. The win sees Chiefs leapfrog Royal AM to second spot on the standings with 35 points, eleven behind champions in waiting, Mamelodi Sundowns.
