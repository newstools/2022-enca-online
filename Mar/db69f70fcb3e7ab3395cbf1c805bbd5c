The Good Governance's executive director Boyce Mpempe said, "the situation is very bad...the conditions under which the community is subjected to live in is very dehumanising, it can never be thought as it being befitting for human beings to live under." "The crisis is all about power, patronage, the desire to steal public funds...people have been promised better life for all over the years...we had hoped that the new council would come in and do better, but things have gone from worse to total collapse...all what they're doing is desire to steal and enrich themselves."
