Top of the world: Japan's Kaori Sakamoto skates to the world title on Friday. AFP/Sylvain Thomas MONTPELLIER - Japan's Kaori Sakamoto on Friday added the world figure skating title to her Olympic bronze medal, capitalising on the absence of Russian rivals banned following the invasion of Ukraine. The 21-year-old Sakamoto totalled 236.09 points with Belgium's Loena Hendrickx (217.70) taking silver and Alysa Liu of the United States claiming bronze (211.9). At the Beijing Olympics last month, Russia claimed gold and silver through Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova while European champion Kamila Valieva was fourth after spending the Games embroiled in a drugs controversy. The tearful Sakamoto improved her personal bests in both the short and free programmes in Montpellier. She is also the first Japanese world champion since Mao Asada in 2014. "It was really difficult in training before the worlds. I was tired and on the verge of exhaustion after the Olympics, but most of us were in the same situation," said Sakamoto. "The hard training I had in the past helped me to hold on during this competition." Hendrickx, meanwhile, became the first Belgian skater to make a world podium. Belgium has only won three world medals in figure skating -- the previous two coming in pairs skating in 1947 and 1948. At just 16, Liu is also a first-time world medallist, a month after a seventh place at the Olympics. For Russian skating, Friday represented the end of an era of dominance. Since 2015 -- with the exception of 2018 and the cancellation of the 2020 event because of the pandemic -- Russia had a gold medallist in the women's competition every year. Russian skaters also swept the podium at the 2021 worlds and at the European Championships in January this year.
