Investors are keeping an eye on developments in the US debt row and the China Evergrande crisis as well as the Federal Reserve's plans to tighten monetary policy. AFP/Daniel Roland LONDON - Asian and European markets were mixed on Monday after last week's rally, while oil prices extended gains, with investors keeping tabs on the war in Ukraine as Turkey said Kyiv and Moscow were edging towards a ceasefire agreement. Confidence remains at a premium owing to the crisis in eastern Europe -- which threatens to deal a hefty blow to the global economy -- as well as central bank monetary tightening measures. Traders struggled to maintain the buying enthusiasm seen last week that was fuelled by bargain-buying and China's pledge to support beaten-down markets and indication that a crackdown on the tech sector was nearing an end. After a healthy performance on Wall Street on Friday, Asia struggled to maintain momentum. Hong Kong fell for a second day following the massive gains enjoyed on Wednesday and Thursday after Chinese authorities announced they would provide support to markets battered by recent volatility. But the lack of specifics as of Monday weighed on sentiment. There was little major reaction after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam unveiled plans to ease containment measures and lift a ban on flights from several countries including Britain and the United States. Sydney, Seoul, Mumbai, Manila, Jakarta and Bangkok also slipped, but Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei and Wellington edged up. Tokyo was closed for a holiday. London opened flat, while Paris and Frankfurt edged down. US futures were lower. "Stabilising stock markets point to less cautious investors," said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management. "Not because views on geopolitical or policy/rates risk have improved but because price action shows a market more tolerant of those challenges."
