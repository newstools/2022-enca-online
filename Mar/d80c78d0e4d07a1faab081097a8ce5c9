One of the researchers says all three species were 6 to 7 tons, with similar skulls and bodies and it would be like the difference between being attacked by a lion or tiger. But, other scientists have expressed some skepticism, highlighting just how difficult it is to draw precise conclusions about creatures from tens of millions of years ago.
