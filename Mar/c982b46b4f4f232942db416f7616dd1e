The embattled utility says generation capacity has recovered sufficiently. Businesses, learning, healthcare, and service delivery have been affected by power cuts as South Africa is gripped by an unreliable power supply. Eskom has apologised for implementing blackouts during the past week. It's urging people to continue using electricity sparingly.
