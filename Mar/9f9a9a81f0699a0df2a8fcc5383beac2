Actors Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz arrive for the world premiere of 'The Batman' in New York. AFP/Angela Weiss LOS ANGELES - "The Batman" held fast to its leading position in North American theaters this weekend, with a strong take estimated at $66-million, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported. With few new wide releases coming in what promises to be a quiet March, "Batman will carry the month," said analyst David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research, who predicts a "thin" release schedule through May. Warner Bros.'s long and noirish take on the Caped Crusader -- Robert Pattinson stars in the title role, with Paul Dano as the Riddler, Colin Farrell as the Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman -- has now surpassed $238-million domestically and $224-million internationally, more than justifying its $200-million production budget. Sony adventure film "Uncharted," starring Tom Holland as an Indiana Jones-style treasure hunter, held in second place in its fourth week out, taking in an estimated $9.3-million for the Friday-through-Sunday period. In third was a surprising entry. "BTS Permission to Dance on Stage: Seoul," from Trafalgar Releasing, earned $6.8-million to become the top-grossing live cinema event of all time, according to Hollywood Reporter. Live-event cinema -- which started mostly with opera performances -- has been gaining popularity. That knocked Metro Goldwyn Mayer's road-trip comedy "Dog" down one spot to fourth; it took in $5.3-million. Channing Tatum plays an army veteran who drives Lulu, a dog injured while working with the military in Afghanistan, to her former handler's funeral. And in fifth was Sony blockbuster "Spider-Man: No Way Home," with $4.1-million in ticket sales in its 13th week out. With Tom Holland playing the popular web-slinger, the film's international earnings are nearing $1.1-billion.
