The City of Ekurhuleni’s power substation experienced a total power supply failure early on Saturday morning.
The substation supplies power to Rand Water’s Mapleton booster station.
Rand Water's Eddie Singo said, "the Ekurhuleni technical team worked throughout the two groups of reservoirs had already depleted."
At this stage only the Ekurhuleni municipality is affected.
Singo said, "we are monitoring consumption and those reservoirs.. it will take us as consumers to use water sparingly."
Where possible consumers in Ekurhuleni are being asked to avoid activities that will consume large amounts of water like gardening.
The reservoirs affected are expected to be have their capacity restored to comfortable levels by the end of the day. #Ekurhulenipoweroutage #watersupply #waterwise #reduceconsumption #mapleton@City_Ekurhuleni@CityTshwane pic.twitter.com/YyfNP3YvZc
