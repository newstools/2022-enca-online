AFP/Lakruwan Wanniarachchi COLOMBO - Sri Lanka's most sacred elephant passed away aged 68, prompting an outpouring of grief and a presidential order for the huge cadaver to be stuffed and preserved for posterity. Nadungamuwa Raja was the most important among 100 elephants used in an annual pageant involving fire-eaters and drummers, tasked with carrying a golden casket of Buddhist relics on its back. Mourners -- including schoolchildren, priests in saffron robes and an elderly lady with a Zimmer frame -- paid their respects to Raja, praying and touching its mighty tusks in reverence. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa decreed that the animal be declared a "national treasure" and ordered its remains be preserved "for future generations to witness," his office said. Raja was due to be handed over to taxidermists for stuffing after Buddhist funeral rites have been performed, its owner said through a spokesperson. - Hunt for successor - Choosing a successor will be a lengthy process. The chosen elephant has to be from a particular caste with special physical characteristics to qualify. When the elephant stands, seven points -- the four legs, its trunk, penis and tail -- must all touch the ground. The animal must also have a flat back, the tusks must be formed in the shape of a traditional winnow and its height must be about 3.6m. An exception was made with Raja because it was the tallest in the country at the time. Raja was born in India and had been gifted to Sri Lanka by an Indian prince. Elephants are a protected species in Sri Lanka but many are kept as pets because they are seen as status symbols. Laws have been tightened in recent years to ban the capture of wild elephants which is punishable with death. Animal rights campaigners say captive elephants are often maltreated, a charge denied by temples and owners of domesticated elephants.
