Khaya Zondo of Hollywoodbets Dolphins bowled by Sisanda Magala of Imperial Lions during the 2022 CSA T20 Challenge game between Hollywoodbets Dolphins and Imperial Lions at St Georges Park in Port Elizabeth on 10 February 2022 © Deryck Foster/BackpagePix JOHANNESBURG - Khaya Zondo has been included in the Proteas test squad for the very first time. The Dolphins batsman has been in good form domestically and now has a chance to fight for a spot in the starting eleven against Bangladesh. Zondo testified at last year's SJN hearings about the discrimination he faced on the Proteas tour to India, where he was overlooked for selection. Titans' Lizaad Williams makes a return to the squad, while Zubayr Hamza has had to withdraw from the whole series for personal reasons. The Proteas will face Bangladesh without some of their teammates, who will be playing in the IPL.
