This after the City of Johannesburg started back-dating sewage and refuse bills from 2018. Landlords claim the billing system has been changed unlawfully, which has led to them paying more. This means tenants could see increases in rent. The Johannesburg Property Owners and Managers Association is now taking the City to court. eNCA’s senior journalist Aviwe Mtila has the story in the video above.
