Striking gold: Japan's Shoma Uno reached the top step of the podium at last. AFP/Pascal Guyot MONTPELLIER - Japan's Shoma Uno was finally crowned men's world figure skating champion at the sixth attempt in Montpellier on Saturday as French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron won a fifth world crown. Uno, totalled 312.48 points, a new personal best, to take the title in the absence of the injured stars, compatriot Yuzuru Hanyu and American Nathan Chen. Chen, a triple world champion who claimed Olympic gold last month in Beijing, is suffering from a "persistent" but unspecified injury. Hanyu, a double Olympic champion and double world champion, has a problem with his right ankle. "I am finally first," said Uno, who took Olympic silver in 2018 and bronze in February and has twice been a runner up in the world championship. Uno, who also took Olympic team bronze in Beijing, led after the short programme and landed five quadruple jumps on Saturday as he skated to Ravel's Bolero. He beat his 18-year-old compatriot Yuma Kagiyama, second in the Olympics, who scored 297.60 points. American Vincent Zhou was third on 277.38.
