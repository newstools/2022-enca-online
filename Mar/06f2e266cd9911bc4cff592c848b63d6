AFP/Pedro Pardo MEXICO CITY - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday inaugurated a new international airport for Mexico City -- one of his flagship projects -- but so far many airlines are hesitant to use it. Felipe Angeles International Airport, built at a military airbase north of the capital, began operating with a domestic Aeromexico flight bound for Villahermosa in Lopez Obrador's home state of Tabasco. "The airport is 100 percent complete," Lopez Obrador said at his daily news conference held at the new airport. "It's just a matter of airlines increasing their trips" from Felipe Angeles, he said. READ: New Mexico City airport nears take-off, with few flights So far, only three national airlines -- Volaris, Viva Aerobus and Aeromexico -- as well as Venezuela's Conviasa have agreed to operate a limited number of mostly domestic flights from Felipe Angeles. Lopez Obrador said he was optimistic that Mexico would soon recover its Category 1 aviation safety rating from the US Federal Aviation Administration, following a downgrade last year that prevents US carriers from opening new services or routes to the country. Felipe Angeles, named after a general in the Mexican revolution, is meant to take the pressure off Benito Juarez airport, which will continue operating. Benito Juarez, which handled a record 50.3 million passengers in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic, is one of the busiest airports in Latin America.
