Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former SABC acting COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng believes his political opponents are out to tarnish his name. The Special Investigating Unit wants him to pay back R2.5-million which it says was irregularly given to more than 100 artists. Motsoeneng maintains the money, which was meant as a token of gratitude to the artists, was sourced from the private sector and not taken from the Public Broadcaster, as alleged by the SIU. READ: Former SABC COO, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, ordered to pay R11.5m "What SIU did, they went and talked to people who know nothing....about the funding of those artists," he said. "I've been saying this is more political. Those politicians who are against me are afraid that if they don't tarnish my name, I will emerge as one of the leaders of SA. People are very afraid of me. "I don't regret or apologise for what I did."
