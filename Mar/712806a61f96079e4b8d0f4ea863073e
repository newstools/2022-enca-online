Brown INDIAN WELLS - Serbia's 61st-ranked Miomir Kecmanovic shocked sixth-seeded Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 6-4 to book a quarter-final clash with Taylor Fritz at the ATP Indian Wells Masters. The 22-year-old Kecmanovic equalled the biggest win of his career as he reached the last eight of a Masters level event for the second time. Berrettini, runner-up to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2021, is at a career-high sixth in the world after reaching the Australian Open semi-finals in January. But he couldn't find the answer against an aggressive Kecmanovic, who pressured Berrettini's serve throughout. Unable to convert two break points in the eighth game of the final set, Kecmanovic broke Berrettini to love in the final game, letting out a shout of triumph as the Italian sent a forehand wide on match point. Kecmanovic will now be hoping to go further than his quarter-final run in the California desert in 2019. Standing in his way will be 20th-seeded American Fritz, who shook off a slow start to beat Australian Alex de Minaur 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/5).
