Sweden's Armand Duplantis has broken his own world record twice this month. AFP/Andrej Isakovic BELGRADE - Sweden's Mondo Duplantis held his nerve to better his world pole vault record at the World Indoor Championships in Belgrade on Sunday. Duplantis went clear at 6.20 metres on the third time of asking in raucous conditions at the Stark Arena to improve by 1cm his previous best set two weeks ago in the same Serbian venue. The Swede joined the competition with the bar at 5.60m, going on to pass four times as rivals fell by the wayside. Duplantis saw American Chris Nilsen fail at 5.95m and Brazil's Rio Olympic champion Thiago Braz at 6.05m. With gold secured, the bar was immediately raised to 6.20m, but Duplantis failed in his first two attempts in chaotic, noisy scenes as the 4x400m relays were held on the track. After they had finished, the Swede took a deep breath and shot down the bright blue runway, the crowd exploding as he sailed over the bar. "It's one of these situations that you don't know what's happening until the moment's passed," said the 22-year-old Swedish Olympic champion who had warned when he cleared 6.19m in an almost empty arena on March 7 that he had more in the tank. "I was so focused on getting the gold medal. And then when it's time to jump at 6.20m, it's a bonus. I'm playing with free chips at that point." Duplantis said he wanted to continue to "push barriers". "I want to be a guy jumping high in big meets," he said. "It's super surreal. I'm just grateful for my position and try not to take it for granted. "I'm in a position where I've jumped 6 metres enough to realise it's possible (to go for record jumps) on any given day. "But I know I'm not going to break the record every day, I just go out there and try to jump as high as I can. I have a good grasp of what I need to be at the top of the top." It was Duplantis' first record in the presence of his father and coach Greg, saying it was "extra special he was there to witness it".
