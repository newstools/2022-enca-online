JOHANNESBURG - Comrades Marathon will now allow unvaccinated runners to compete in the race in August this year. This follows President Cyril Ramaphosa's announcement of new adjustments to the COVID-19 restrictions under level 1. Organisers say this will only be possible for runners who submit a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of race day.
