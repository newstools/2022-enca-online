He said, "this is a week that reminds us that we are still a nation in pain because of the role the late His Majesty had occupied as the father and the unifier, we had not imagined a life without him, and it is because of thus reason that his demise plunged the province and the whole country into a sea of untold grief." "However, we had to live with the sobering reality that he is no more. Despite his demise, he still lives in our collective minds and hearts." "As we approach the first year since his majesty's passing on, we have a responsibility to pick up the spear and to march on as we build a better KZN." "In this regard, led by the royal family, as KZN  and the people of the province stand ready to play our supportive role where appropriate and required in order to ensure  that activities to honour the legacy of the late his majesty, the king is a success."
