After an emergency audit, the Civil Aviation Authority says the company flouted its own rules. The audit follows a spate of incidents. In mid-February, an engine-related problem forced a Kulula.com flight from Lanseria to Cape Town to divert to OR Tambo International. WATCH | Anger at SA's airports as Kulula, BA flights remain suspended A couple of weeks later- a British Airways flight from East London to Johannesburg had to make an emergency landing due to faulty landing gear. Last weekend, one of Comair's British Airways flights from Gqeberha experienced landing problems at Cape Town's International Airport- again due to an issue with its landing gear indicator.
