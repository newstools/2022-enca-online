  SPONSORED - The Homeland Webinar provides a vital discursive platform addressing the multifaceted issues facing refugee communities. Inspired by Neill Solomon’s song, Homeland, and conceptualised by a documentary from Firdoze Bulbulia, the webinar brings together a panel of socially conscious artists, musicians and advocates in an effort to evoke both a deeper understanding of displacement and xenophobia, as well as a platform to discuss a socially cohesive means of addressing the humanitarian issues that face refugees on a daily basis. panelist :
