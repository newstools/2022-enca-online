Australia's Steve Smith watches the ball after playing a shot during the fourth day of the third and final Test cricket match between Pakistan and Australia. AFP/Aamir Qureshi LAHORE - Senior batter Steve Smith has been ruled out of Australia's upcoming limited-overs matches with Pakistan due to a recurrence of a left elbow injury, Cricket Australia said. The 32-year-old became the fastest batter to complete 8,000 runs during the final Test in Lahore that Australia won by 115 runs to clinch the series 1-0 on Friday. The first two Tests -- in Rawalpindi and Karachi -- ended in draws. Smith said he was disappointed not to be part of the one-day international series starting in Lahore from Tuesday. "It's disappointing to miss these matches against Pakistan but after chatting with the medical staff I can see the need to take a break at this time," Smith was quoted saying in a Cricket Australia release. "I do not regard this as a major issue but by staying on top of things now, we can ensure that it doesn't become something more significant further down the line." Australia's selectors named leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson as Smith's replacement. The second ODI is on Thursday and the third on Saturday followed by one Twenty20 international on April 5 -- with all matches in Lahore. Smith will return home alongside Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and David Warner later Saturday.
