The Senegalese Muslim brotherhood of the Layene, founded by Seydina Limamou Laye (1843-1909), advocates unity and equality. This, the pilgrims said, is why all of them were dressed the same way, and all are named Laye. One of the pilgrims, Ousmane Laye, told AFP that "the founder of the brotherhood announced that he is the reincarnation of the Prophet Mohammed, which is why he is considered a messenger of God".
