Mosimane admitted his side is under pressure to win the Caf Champions League. The Cairo’s Red Devils are in South Africa and will take on Mamelodi Sundowns in a Group A match at FNB Stadium. Sundowns are equally expected to deliver the coveted silverware after bagging their maiden crown in 2016. Sundowns goalkeeper, Kennedy Mweene insists the Brazilians will regard the FNB Stadium as their home ground when they host Al Ahly this afternoon. This after CAF refused to approve their venues as they failed to met CAF standards.
