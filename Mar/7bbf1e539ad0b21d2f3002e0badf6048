AFP/PIB NEW DELHI - Australia has returned 29 religious and cultural artefacts to India, among them several stolen or illegally exported from the country, earning thanks from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. New Delhi has pushed Western governments and museums to identify and return objects of India's "stolen heritage", and hundreds of items from overseas collections have already been repatriated. Thirteen of the works returned by Australia are connected to alleged trafficker Subhash Kapoor, a former Manhattan art dealer who was the subject of a massive US federal investigation known as Operation Hidden Idol. "I would like to especially thank you for the initiative to return ancient Indian artefacts," Modi told his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison during a virtual meeting of the leaders. "These include statues and paintings that are hundreds of years old and that have been illegally taken out... now we can return them to the places where they belong." The objects -- including sculptures, paintings, photographs and a scroll -- date back to the 9th century and were held by the National Gallery of Australia. The museum first announced the return of works it acquired through Kapoor last July, including a US$5 million bronze statue of the Hindu god Shiva that had been stolen from a temple in southern India. Kapoor was arrested in 2011 and is currently in jail awaiting trial. He denies all charges. Experts estimate that thousands of artworks are stolen from Indian temples each year and shipped to a thriving international antiquities market. These artefacts are generally smuggled out under fake documentation and concealed in furniture or garment consignments. Most never return to India. Barry O'Farrell, Australia's high commissioner to India, said the restitution of the artefacts was a symbol of strong diplomatic ties "built on deep bonds of trust and cooperation".
