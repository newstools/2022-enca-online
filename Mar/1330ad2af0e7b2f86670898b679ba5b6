Stats SA head, Risenga Maluleke spoke with eNCA about the progress of the census. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke says he will not hesitate to extend the deadline for the census if necessary. 20 March is the deadline for everyone to be counted. WATCH | Census 2022 extended “Initially we were supposed to end online self-enumeration on 5 February, then moved it to mid-February, but only 25 percent of them have returned the forms," Maluleke said. "We have realised that if we wait for them there will be more risk rather we deploy our field staff….the numbers were just coming in drips and drabs and we headed to 20 March. But if we get to the 25th and we realise that we haven’t counted everyone, I will not hesitate as the Statistician-General to extend because we have a responsibility to count everyone within the borders of South Africa.”
