The head of SAFA referees is set to investigate these ugly scenes in the match between Dondol FC and MM Platinum in Mamelodi. Fans were unhappy with the officiating in the match, and the referee had to be whisked away at full time. Platinum won the match 1-0, much to the anger of Dondol supporters who accused the ref of costing them the match. The referee was escorted to safety with the help of Dondol chairman Lordwick Makhura. The ABC Motsepe League is suffering from an image problem and is often dogged by allegations of corruption.
