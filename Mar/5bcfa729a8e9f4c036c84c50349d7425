Marquez has endured a series of injuries since his last MotoGP world title in 2019 PARIS - Six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez will miss this weekend's Argentina Grand Prix after suffering from double vision again following a heavy crash in Indonesia, his team Honda said on Tuesday. The Spaniard suffered a concussion after a spectacular crash in the Indonesian Grand Prix earlier this month, when his Honda cartwheeled end-over-end as it disintegrated, before he landed on his left arm and smacked his helmet on the ground. Marquez also suffered from diplopia, or double vision, at the end of last season. "The Honda Team rider will not take part in the next round of the MotoGP World Championship that takes place this weekend in Argentina as he continues his recovery," Honda said in a statement. The 29-year-old initially said the problem was "less severe" than the diplopia which forced him to miss the last two races of the 2021 season. Honda added on Tuesday that Marquez had already shown "very favourable improvements". Marquez, who finished fifth in the first race of 2022 in Qatar, has struggled with a series of injuries in recent seasons. He missed almost the entirety of the 2020 campaign after breaking his right arm in the season-opening race. Marquez also sat out the first two Grands Prix last year before struggling to recapture his best form when he returned. However, he did win back-to-back races before the initial bout of diplopia. add/jc/pi
