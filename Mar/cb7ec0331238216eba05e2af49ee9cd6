AFP/Cliff Hawkins/Getty FLORIDA - Defending champion Sam Burns closed with back-to-back birdies to match Venezuela's Jhonattan Vegas, Canada's Adam Hadwin and US compatriot David Lipsky for the lead after Thursday's opening round of the US PGA Valspar Championship. Burns, Vegas, Lipsky and Hadwin each fired seven-under-par 64s at Innisbrook resort's Copperhead course in Palm Harbor, Florida. Only Lipsky, chasing his first US PGA title, had a bogey-free round, his longest birdie putt from just outside 10 feet. "My iron play was excellent. I hit it close a lot," Lipsky said. "I didn't really leave myself too many stressful par saves. Drove it relatively straight and that's a formula to go well." The only first-round Valspar leader or co-leader to win the title was South Korean K.J. Choi in 2002. New Zealand's Danny Lee and Americans Scott Stallings, Davis Riley and Richy Werenski shared fifth on 65. World number 17 Burns won his only other PGA title last October at the Sanderson Farms Championship but has fond memories of last year's victory. "I'll look back forever on that event, it being my first win," Burns said. "Wins don't happen out here often, so I think it's good to reflect and just be extremely grateful." The 25-year-old American birdied three of four par-5 holes and all four par-3 holes, the last a tap-in at the 17th after putting an 8-iron shot inches from the cup. Burns made a 14-foot birdie putt at the 18th. "I honestly thought I missed it," Burns said. "It hit something and kind of shot a little right halfway. But it caught the right side."
