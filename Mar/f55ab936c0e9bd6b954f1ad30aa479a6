But over the last few years, that accolade has gone to Mamelodi Sundowns. This weekend, the Soweto rivals face off in the derby with nothing but pride to play for and no trophies to show for yet another season. Chiefs and Pirates lie third and fourth respectively in the league standings. And they both trail leaders Sundowns by a whopping 19 points. The derby goes into its fourth spell without the attendance of fans, as the country awaits a decision on their return to venues.
