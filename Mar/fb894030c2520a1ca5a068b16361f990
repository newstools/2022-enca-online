The finance watchdog says while overall the health department can’t be faulted for its vaccine programme, there have been shortcomings. This also includes protecting itself from possible collusive bidding from vaccine suppliers. The Auditor General’s Office briefed Parliament’s health committee today on its audit. eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger shares more details in the video above.
