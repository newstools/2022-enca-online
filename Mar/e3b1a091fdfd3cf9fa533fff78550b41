AFP/Sam Greenwood/Getty ORLANDO - Billy Horschel rolled in a 28-foot birdie putt from off the green at 18 on Saturday to grab a share of the third-round lead alongside Talor Gooch at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Horschel, the 2014 FedEx Cup champion, had four birdies in his one-under-par 71 on a day when gusting winds and slick greens made for tough going at Bay Hill in Orlando, Florida. Gooch joined Horschel on seven-under-par 209 with an even-par 72. "It was a tough, tough day out there," Horschel said. "I did a really good job of staying patient. To make that putt on 18 to shoot one-under par on a really tough day is really satisfying." Gooch had jarred a 33-foot birdie putt at 15 and a 14-footer at 16 to reach eight-under, then got up and down for par from a greenside bunker at the par-three 17th. But he missed a five and a half foot par putt at 18, his fourth bogey of the day dropping him into a share of the lead. Amid the swings and struggles of the day, overnight pacesetter Viktor Hovland had led by as many as four strokes, shaking off a bogey-bogey start with an eagle at the sixth, where he holed out from a greenside bunker. The world number four from Norway curled in a 10-foot birdie at the eighth, but he was four-over on the back nine in a three-over par round capped by back-to-back bogeys that robbed of even a share of the lead. At six-under 210, Hovland was one stroke in front of Scottie Scheffler, who matched the best round of the day with a four-under-par 68 for 211.
