"The rapidly changing global environment and spillovers related to the war in Ukraine are posing important challenges for countries around the world, including Egypt," the lender's mission chief in Egypt Celine Allard said in a statement. "In that context, the Egyptian authorities have requested the International Monetary Fund's support to implement their comprehensive economic program." Egypt is heavily reliant on wheat imports from Russia and Ukraine, and its inflation rate hit 10 percent in February amid a wider spike in global commodity prices caused by the war.

Last June, Cairo received the final disbursement of a program totalling $5.4-billion to help the country during the Covid-19 pandemic. Egypt has undertaken tough austerity measures including slashing subsidies and floating the local currency in 2016 as part of IMF-backed economic reforms. Poor and middle-class Egyptians have been especially hit by the policies, which saw inflation peak at 34 percent in 2017.
