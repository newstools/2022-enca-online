They say the new ANC-led coalition has not been sharing projects equitably. The businesses had previously received at least 30 percent participation in major projects. They're also demanding that a consulting group, hired to allocate projects to SMMEs, be reinstated after its services were suspended. * eNCA's Nceba Ntlanganiso reports.
