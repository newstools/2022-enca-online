AFP/MIchael Bradley HAMILTON - West Indies’ bowlers proved too good as they ripped through Bangladesh’s batting order to claim a run win at Mount Maunganui in New Zealand. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to field first as they searched for their second victory at the tournament. Shemaine Campbelle contributed with a half-century as the Windies posted 140 for 9 after 50 overs. In their chase, Bangladesh came within touching distance. However, the superb bowling of Hayley Matthews, Afy Fletcher and Stafanie Taylor proved otherwise. Mathews took four wickets with Fletcher and Taylor claiming three each as West Indies claimed a 4-run victory.
