AFP/Sanka Vidanagama CHRISTCHURCH - The  Proteas have done it. South Africa have managed to chase down 275 for victory in their last group match at the Cricket World Cup. India opted to bat first in Christchurch after winning the toss and posted a challenging total for South Africa to chase. And that's exactly what the Proteas set out to do, holding their nerve as the required rate came down to a run a ball for a three-wicket win. Once again, South Africa's innings was anchored by Laura Wolvaardt who top-scored with 80.
