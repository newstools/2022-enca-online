AFP/Odd Andersen WASHINGTON - A massive container ship, owned by the same company whose vessel last year blocked the Suez Canal, has run aground near the US port of Baltimore, US officials said. The Ever Forward, a 334m vessel, ran aground in the Chesapeake Bay shortly after leaving a Baltimore port Sunday night, said the executive director of the Maryland Port Administration, William Doyle, in a statement.

"The ship's grounding is not preventing other ships from transiting to the Port of Baltimore," he added, noting that efforts had been underway since Sunday night to free the stranded vessel. The accident came almost exactly a year after the 200,000-ton container ship MV Ever Given became wedged in the Suez Canal during a sandstorm, blocking the key waterway for six days.
