This is after the Western Cape Division of the High Court struck the ATM's urgent application from the roll. The party wanted the court to declare the Speaker’s refusal for a secret ballot invalid and inconsistent with the Constitution. The court ruled the urgency in this matter had been created by the ATM and it could have brought its application earlier. eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger has the details in the video above.
