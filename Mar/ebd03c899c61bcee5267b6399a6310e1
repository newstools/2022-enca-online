Magic: Defending champion Paula Badosa celebrates victory over Veronika Kudermetova in the WTA quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. AFP/Frederic J. Brown INDIAN WELLS - Defending champion Paula Badosa solved the riddle of Veronika Kudermetova, cruising past the 21st seed 6-3, 6-2 to set up a semi-final clash with Maria Sakkari at the Indian Wells WTA and ATP Masters on Thursday. Sakkari, coming off a run to the final in Saint Petersburg that helped propel her past Badosa into sixth in the world rankings, beat Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina 7-5, 6-4. Badosa had lost all three of her prior meetings with Kudermetova, but she was in control throughout on a sunsplashed Stadium Court. "I played against her and I was always making the same mistakes so today I didn't want to do it for the fourth time in a row. I started to serve very well, I think that was the key, and I stayed very aggressive and didn't let her move a lot." Badosa gained the only break she needed in the fourth game of the opening set and broke Kudermetova twice for a 4-1 lead in the second. She saved the only break point she faced in the match and wrapped it up on her first match point when Kudermetova sent a second straight service return long. "I think it's the court, it does magic with me," Badosa said of the venue where she lifted the trophy in October, when the tournament was moved from its usual March slot because of the coronavirus pandemic.
