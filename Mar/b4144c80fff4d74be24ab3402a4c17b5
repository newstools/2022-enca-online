The ECOWAS talks in the Ghanian capital Accra came three months after the bloc slapped tough sanctions on Mali. AFP/Nipah Dennis ACCRA - West Africa's regional bloc said it would maintain sanctions on Mali over the military rulers of the Sahel country delaying a return to civilian rule after a coup. At the end of a summit in Ghana, the Economic Community of West African States also issued warnings to the juntas that recently seized power in Guinea and Burkina Faso. ECOWAS said military leaders in Guinea should provide "an acceptable timeline for transition" by the end of April, or it would slap punitive measures on the government and the National Transition Council (CNT). The bloc added in a statement that, if Burkina Faso's junta did not free former president Roch Marc Christian Kabore from house arrest by Thursday next week, "individual sanctions" would also ensue. The talks in the Ghanian capital Accra came three months after the bloc slapped tough sanctions on Mali. They had opened "behind closed doors between heads of state", Malian Foreign Minister Aboudlaye Diop tweeted earlier in the day. The leader of Mali's junta, Assimi Goita, was invited to the summit, according to an ECOWAS document seen by AFP. But it was unclear at the opening if he was in attendance, physically or virtually. The summit came about a week after an ECOWAS envoy for Mali travelled to Bamako, but the talks on restoring civilian rule were inconclusive. The 15-nation bloc is pushing for Mali's military, which seized power in 2020, to stage elections within 12-16 months. But strongman Goita has so far defied international pressure to hold elections.
