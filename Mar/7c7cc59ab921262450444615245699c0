AFP/Daniel Munoz BOGOTA - Preliminary toxicology tests found that Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins had marijuana, opioids and other drugs in his system before he died, Colombian investigators said. Hawkins, the 50-year-old drummer for the Grammy award-winning rock group, passed away in a hotel in Bogota shortly before the group was set to perform at the Festival Estereo Picnic on the city's outskirts, according to a statement Saturday from the mayor's office. Colombian investigators said preliminary post-mortem tests found several drugs in the musician's system, but did not specify whether the mix caused his death. "The urine toxicology tests performed on Taylor Hawkins' body preliminarily found 10 types of substances," including THC -- which is found in marijuana -- tricyclic anti-depressants, benzodiazepines and opioids, investigators said in a statement.

The mayor's office said a local emergency line received a call late Friday about a "patient complaining of chest pains." A doctor "performed the respective resuscitation maneuvers, but there was no response and the patient was declared deceased," it added, giving no cause of death. The festival announced the cancellation of the group's show, as well as another one set for Sunday in Sao Paulo. Thousands of shocked and tearful fans at the Bogota venue lit candles and held a minute of silence after the news broke. "The Foo Fighters family is devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved Taylor Hawkins," the band said in a statement on Twitter. "His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever."
