  JOHANNESBURG - At least 4,000 healthcare workers may be jobless by 1 April. The Gauteng Health Department says due to financial constraints it cannot renew contracts of workers under the Expanded Public Works Programme. In protest, members of the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers spent two nights outside the department’s offices to get the attention of the MEC. 
  
They are demanding to be permanently employed. The union plans to meet with officials from the department next week. If their demands are not met, they have vowed to intensify their protest.
