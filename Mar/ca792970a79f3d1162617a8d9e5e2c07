AmaZulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini. PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa has recognised Misuzulu as the Amazulu king. This follows the passing of King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu last year. The king's passing was quickly followed by that of Queen Regent, Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu. Prince Misuzulu was then named her heir. This was contested by some members of the royal family, but their challenge was dismissed by a court recently. The president's recognition comes after consultations with the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister and the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal. Ramaphosa has extended good wishes to Misuzulu, saying he is part of a long line of monarchs who fought with great courage and determination.
