The 63-year-old woman has been a nurse since 1981, her last job at Soweto’s Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. She was forced to retire last September after a back injury. But to this day, she still has not been paid out. The Gauteng Health Department said they are aware of this case and that the nurse’s papers are with the Government Employee Provident Fund for processing after HR at Bara realised a mistake in one of her forms. They also say they have many other cases that have not been finalised. * eNCA’s Masego Rahlaga reports.
