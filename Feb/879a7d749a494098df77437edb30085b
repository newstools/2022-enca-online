The Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg has been stripped of this season's Champions League final NYON - Paris will host this season's Champions League final after Saint Petersburg was stripped of the match due to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, UEFA announced on Friday. The showpiece occasion of the European club season will be played at the Stade de France on Saturday, May 28, European football's governing body said after holding an emergency meeting in response to the crisis. "UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football's most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis," a statement said. "Together with the French government, UEFA will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement." The final was supposed to be played at the Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg, which already hosted several matches at last year's European Championship and at the 2018 World Cup held in Russia. UEFA made no reference to its relationship with Gazprom, the Russian state energy giant that is a key sponsor of European football's governing body. However, UEFA did announce that Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams competing in international competitions must play home matches at neutral venues "until further notice". FIFA may now move to force Russia to play their World Cup qualifying play-off against Poland on March 24 on neutral ground. Spartak Moscow, in the Europa League, are the only club from either Russia or Ukraine still involved in European competition this season.
