Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Chris Hani's family and the SACP are opposing the convicted assassin Janusz Walus's application to the Constitutional Court. Walus wants to overturn Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola's decision to deny him parole. WATCH: Chris Hani – a soldier, a father, a leader Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane says the nature of  Walus's crime wasn't merely murder of an individual, but murder of a democratic dream. " My learned friend tried to ask about people who've killed others, cooked them...he doesn't know whether they ate them..But, of course, therein lies the misunderstanding about the nature of this crime, that they nature of this crime was not merely a murder of an individual..it was actually a murder of a democratic dream ....so this crime if one analyses it doesn't help to look at it as murder of a person." "It's a murder of a person who symbolised what the future have.......It was to make sure the democratic dream of the South African citizens doesn't happen," he said.
