Abdelilah Madkour of Raja Casablanca attempts to get past Tercious Malepe of Amazulu during the CAF Champions League 2021/22 football match. BackpagePix RABAT - Amazulu made a losing start to their Caf Champions League campaign with a 0-1 defeat to Morocco’s Raja Casablanca. Usuthu were unlucky not to share the spoils in their Group B opening encounter at the Stade Mohammed V Stadium in Morocco. Despite a few chances, they couldn’t convert and Raja skipper Mohsine Moutaouali’s 67th-minute goal made all the difference. The defeat sees Usuthu move third on the log after Guinean side Horoya suffered a 1-0 home loss to Algeria’s ES Setif in an earlier Group B match. Benni McCarthy’s men will be looking to revitalise their knockout-round hopes when they host Horoya AC in their second match in Durban on Friday.
