Luke Lotter has experienced the depths of despair in his young life. A car accident that claimed the lives of his family, left him in a coma for nine days and threatened to leave him brain-damaged. But he’s managed to pull through. eNCA's Siphokazi Malinga reports. Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - A trip that Luke Lotter and his family were looking forward to turned into possibly the worst day of his life. Lotter, along with his parents and brother, got into a horrific car accident that claimed the lives of his loved ones. The 19-year-old was the only one that survived but was left paralysed. In 2013 a friend convinced him to participate in wheelchair basketball and he’s never looked back. * eNCA's Siphokazi Malinga reports.
