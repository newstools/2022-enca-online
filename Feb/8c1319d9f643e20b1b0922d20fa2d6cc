Gauteng is the second province with the highest number of cases of murder during the period under review and this is mainly due to the size of the population. "However, when we look at other provinces’ murder rate to ensure a fair comparison among them as expressed in the number of people killed per 100,000 of the population, Gauteng’s murder rate is at 10.3 per 100,000 population, which is lower than the other three provinces. "Out of 1,570 of the people who were killed, 189 were women while 37 of them were children. Furthermore, a total of 41 cases of murders registered during the same period were related to domestic violence where the majority of victims were females 23 and males 18."
