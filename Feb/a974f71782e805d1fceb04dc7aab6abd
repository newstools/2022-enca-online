The concert hall said in a statement it was revising its programme for the coming months "in solidarity with the Ukrainian people" following the invasion of the pro-Western country by Russia. It said it had cancelled two concerts in April by Gergiev and the orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg where he is the chief conductor. Gergiev, known for his warm ties with the Kremlin, has yet to issue a statement on the invasion. Last week, he was told by the authorities in the German city of Munich that he risked losing his role as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic if he failed to condemn the war. He has also been dropped from concerts at the Vienna Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall in New York.
