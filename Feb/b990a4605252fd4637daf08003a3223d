Several changes have been made to the adjusted Alert Level 1 of COVID-19 regulations. Going forward those who test positive but are asymptomatic will not have to isolate. Those who test positive and have symptoms will only need to isolate for 7 days instead of 10. Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Research & Innovation at UKZN Professor Mosa Moshabela discusses this.

At the same time, schools will also return to full-time learning and the 1m social distancing has been scrapped. Cabinet says the rationale for these amendments is informed by the proportion of people with immunity to Covid-19 which has risen substantially. Government commends all South Africans who continue to observe COVID-19 regulations and protocols. We also remind those who are yet to get vaccinated to go for their COVID-19 vaccination and continue observing basic health protocols to prevent the transmission of the virus.
