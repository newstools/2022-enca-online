AFP/William West RAWALPINDI - The Australian cricket team is in Pakistan for a series. It's their first time in that country since 1998. The last time the Aussies were in Pakistan, Mark Taylor was captain and on that tour, he equalled Don Bradman's highest test score of 334 before security fears prevented later Australian visits from taking place. This time around the Pakistan Cricket Board is not taking any chances. It's sent out a clear message that security is going to be tight. Some 4,000 police officers have been deployed to ensure the three-test series goes off smoothly. Drills have been taking place at venues at the same time as the hosts have going through their paces, preparing for the first test starting on Friday.
