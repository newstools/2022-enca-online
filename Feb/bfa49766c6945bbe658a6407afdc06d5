Moroccan emergency services teams carry the body of five-year-old Rayan into an ambulance after pulling him from a well shaft. AFP/Fadel Senna IGHRANE - Morocco prepared Monday to bury "little Rayan", the five-year-old boy who died trapped in a well despite a days-long rescue operation that gripped the world. The child's fate drew global attention after he fell down a narrow, 32-metre dry well last Tuesday, and sparked an outpouring of sympathy online. His funeral is to be held in his home village of Ighrane, in the impoverished Rif mountains of northern Morocco where the tragedy took place, a local official and a relative told AFP.

But hope turned to grief as news spread that the rescue was too late, and Rayan was dead. "The silence is terrible this morning in the village," a relative said. The news was announced by the royal cabinet of the North African nation after King Mohammed VI called the parents with his condolences.

"Praise God, have mercy on the dead." Rayan's body was taken to a military hospital in Rabat, according to a cousin, although no report has been given of any autopsy. The race to rescue Rayan was followed live across the world, and as soon as the tragic conclusion was announced, tributes poured in. Pope Francis, while mourning the boy's loss, praised the "beautiful" sight of "how all the people gathered together" to try to save a child.
