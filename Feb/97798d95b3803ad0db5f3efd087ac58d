The country's only driver’s license card machine may be fixed and back in the country, but the latest delay has only worsened a dire backlog. It was standing at almost 400,000 in December. eNCA speaks to Layton Beard from the Automobile Association of South Africa. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Get rid of the current licensing system and replace it. That's what the Automobile Association wants the transport department to do. The AA says the system had problems before the licence card machine broke. And with backlogs mounting, Minister Fikile Mbalula will have no choice but to extend the grace period for expired licenses.

We've got a backlog, we've got a problem because people have been struggling to get appointments to book online for renewal of these documents," the association's Layton Beard said. "People are standing in queues and are not being serviced. The driving licence testing centres are wholly under-resourced. The capacity that they have in terms of their IT infrastructure is very poor which is exactly why the AA is saying rip out the system and replace it, you can't repair that.

But I think that all comes at a cost and that cost is going to have to be unfortunately for the department, the extension of that deadline," he said. "And I venture a guess that this deadline should be extended realistically not just by three or four months but perhaps even until the end of the year."
