AFP/Alberto Pizzoli MILAN - Denis Zakaria has been ruled out of action for around three weeks with a thigh problem, Juventus said on Monday as their injury list continues to grow. In a statement, Juve said that Zakaria's "expected recovery time is approximately 20 days" after injuring a tendon in his left thigh. Switzerland midfielder Zakaria, 25, was substituted not long before half-time in Juve's 3-2 win at Empoli on Saturday, the latest casualty for coach Massimiliano Allegri to deal with. Allegri was missing a host of key players at Empoli, including Federico Chiesa, Weston McKennie, captain Giorgio Chiellini and playmaker Paulo Dybala. However, his team has managed to creep up on Serie A pacesetters Napoli and AC Milan to sit seven points back in fourth, with 11 games to go. Zakaria is expected to be back for Juve's clash with champions Inter Milan, who are two points off the lead in third, after March's international break.
