Smaller artists on Spotify say they'd like to leave the platform -- the way Neil Young and Joni Mitchell did -- but just can't. AFP/Lionel Bonaventure LOS ANGELES - After music legends Neil Young and Joni Mitchell quit Spotify over a Covid misinformation row, some lesser-known artists have said they simply couldn't afford to leave the world's largest music streamer -- despite their concerns. The row sparked a discussion about other artists exiting the platform of more than 170 million subscribers in a stand against Spotify's partnership with podcaster Joe Rogan, who has been accused of promoting vaccine falsehoods on his show. But the opportunity for less well-known artists to reach a large audience and potentially get paid for streams of their music means they feel obligated to stick with Spotify, even though many say the streaming giant unfairly compensates them. "For me, Spotify is kind of a necessary evil," said Leo Sidran, musician and host of the podcast "The Third Story." "To leave Spotify would be a decision to eliminate an enormous potential for people to find me." Acts with smaller followings have to do a lot of their own promotion, which makes platforms like Spotify or other streaming programs -- and their music-hungry audiences -- a way to get onto listeners' playlists. "It's crucial to be heard," said New York-based jazz guitarist Michael Valeanu. "I think those platforms are how people consume music these days." Spotify told AFP that as of 2020, it has paid over $23-billion in royalties to rights holders -- including over $5-billion in 2020 alone. Artists' streaming payments are tied to how in-demand they are, so there will be a financial impact for popular performers such as Mitchell and Young -- and for their record companies.
