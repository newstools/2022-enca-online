Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema (R) shares a moment with former EFF National Chairperson Advocate Dali Mpofu. AFP/Rajesh Jantilal JOHANNESBURG - Civic organisation Freedom Under Law says it's concerned about EFF President Julius Malema and Advocate Dali Mpofu taking part in the search for a new Chief Justice. The organisation says Malema and Mpofu, who are members of the Judicial Services Commission, aren't suitable to partake in such an important task. WATCH: LIVESTREAM | JSC interviews Chief Justice candidates It cited a judgment by the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests which found Malema to have breached Parliament’s Code of Ethical Conduct during interviews for judges by asking a question deemed inappropriate, as well as investigations into Mpofu's conduct when he told a colleague and her client to shut up during the Zondo Commission. Because of this, Freedom Under Law says the two should step aside.
