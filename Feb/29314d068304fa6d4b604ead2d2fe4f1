A piece of the Moon that Christie's sold at auction. AFP/Christie's Auction House NEW YORK - A Christie's auction of rare meteorites sold a rock from space that narrowly missed a German Shepherd when it smashed into his kennel in Costa Rica. But the offer of the third-largest piece of Mars on Earth failed to make an impact at the auction house's annual sale of unusual meteorites. The buyer paid $21,420 for the eight-by-four centimetre carbonaceous chondrite stone that landed in the garden of dog Roky's owner's home in Aguas Zarcas in April 2019. The wood and tin doghouse itself, complete with a seven-inch hole marking where the meteorite punctured the roof, sold separately for $44,100, Christie's said. That was much less than the pre-sale estimate of between $200,000 and $300,000. A bidder paid $189,000 for a chunk of lunar rock that was discovered in Morocco in 2007, below pre-sale estimates of up to $300,000. Another slice of the Moon -- found in the Sahara desert in Mauritania -- fetched $69,300 during the two-week online sale that ended Wednesday. It was a disappointing auction for Mars, though. The 9.1kg Martian rock had been priced at between $500,000 and $800,000 but failed to find a buyer.
