Travis McMichael, his father Gregory McMichael and their neighbor William Bryan were convicted of violating the civil rights of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old African-American man.

During the hate crimes trial, prosecutors recounted the alleged use by the three men of vulgar racial slurs and history of racism. The McMichaels and Bryan chased Arbery in their pickup trucks on February 23, 2020 as he ran through their neighborhood near the town of Brunswick, Georgia. Travis McMichael confronted Arbery as he passed by their truck and shot and killed him. The McMichaels had reached plea deals last month on the hate crimes charges but a judge rejected the deals after Arbery's relatives vehemently objected to the agreements.
