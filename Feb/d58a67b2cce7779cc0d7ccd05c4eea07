AFP/Jean-Guy Python SIERRE - Switzerland's national dish is fondue, a simmering pot of heartwarming melted cheese -- that can now be prepared, stirred up and served by a robot, thanks to some hi-tech wizardry. A Swiss team has been beavering away on Bouebot, the robotic creation putting a futuristic twist on an Alpine tradition. The robot is set to make its grand debut at the Paris International Agricultural Show, one of the world's major food production trade fairs, which runs from February 26 to March 6. Bouebot is for demonstration purposes only and is far from appearing in kitchenware stores. The entire project cost 250,000 to 300,000 Swiss francs, with the robot arm alone costing 80,000 francs. - 'Cheese passion' - Workshop 4.0 co-director Nicolas Fontaine said Bouebot had been nearly two years in the making. "We wanted to do a... project that combined innovation with Swiss tradition, and fondue was the perfect choice," Fontaine told AFP. "For the Swiss, fondue is emblematic. It's something very emotional too because it's part of our identity, our know-how. "Fondue is something convivial... it's a nice opportunity to draw people in to talk about robotics and how it can be used." Whether at home, in a restaurant or in an Alpine cabin, sharing a fondue remains the heart of Swiss social life. Bouebot is named after the bouebos: teenage boys who spent the summer up in the mountain chalets, helping herdsmen while they took care of making cheese.
