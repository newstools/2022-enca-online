Qualifier success: Czech Republic's Jiri Lehecka celebrates after a point against Italy's Lorenzo Musetti. AFP/Sander Koning AMSTERDAM - World number 137 Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic reached his maiden ATP semi-final in Rotterdam on Friday where he will face top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas. Lehecka, a 20-year-old qualifier, defeated Italy's Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 1-6, 7-5 in his quarter-final clash. "It is an incredible feeling. The things I am achieving here are incredible. This is the big stage and I am happy I can be here and play these matches," he said. "Today it was another tough match against an incredibly tough opponent. I will now try and rest ahead of tomorrow and we will see." He is the lowest-ranked Rotterdam semi-finalist since world number 225 Omar Camporese reached the last four in 1995. World number four Tsitsipas eased past Alex de Minaur of Australia 6-4, 6-4 in his last-eight match. "Lehecka has been on a very good winning streak," said Tsitsipas. "I think he's a young talent that can play really good tennis. It's never easy playing someone who you haven't faced before, so match preparation will be very important." Third seed Felix Auger-Aliassime also made the last-four with a 7-5, 7-6 (7/4) win over Cameron Norrie. It was the Canadian's second successive victory over a British player having knocked out former world number one Andy Murray on Wednesday. He next faces Russian second seed and defending champion Andrey Rublev who defeated Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 6-4, 6-3.
