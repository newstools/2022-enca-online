Sara Hector won the Olympic women's giant slalom title after favourite Mikaela Shiffrin slid out on the first run. AFP/Fabrice Coffrini BEIJING - Sweden's Sara Hector won the women's Olympic giant slalom on Monday in a race stripped of a showdown with Mikaela Shiffrin after the American slid out in the first leg. Hector, fastest down on the opening run of two, clocked a combined total of 1min 55.69sec to finish 0.28sec ahead of Italy's Federica Brignone, with current world champion Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland rounding out the podium. Defending champion Shiffrin's bid for a third Olympic gold medal lasted only a handful of gates before she slipped wide and was unable to regain her line. "The day was finished basically before it even started," the 26-year-old said. World Cup slalom standings leader Hector, however, lived up to her own billing as one of the favourites, holding her nerve in a drama-packed second run down the Ice River course that caught out many tipped racers.
