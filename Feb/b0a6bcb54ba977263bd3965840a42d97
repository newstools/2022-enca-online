AFP/Rodger Bosch DURBAN - Coach Neil Powell’s continued dominance with the Springbok Sevens has not gone unnoticed by his domestic side. Powell has been appointed director of Rugby at the Sharks. It's a massive promotion from the defence coach position he signed up for a few months ago. He's set to take up his new position after the Sevens World Cup in Cape Town in September. It will be his final tournament in charge of the Blitzboks. Meanwhile, Sean Everitt will continue as Sharks head coach but will now report to Powell.
