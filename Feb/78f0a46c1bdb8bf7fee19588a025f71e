Hani said, "this chap, whatever his name is, he murdered my husband in cold blood which resulted in my late daughter attempting to commit suicide twice... this child was going for counseling for six years and then died. In my view, he killed my husband and my daughter... this chap, I won't say his name, 20 years later he says he is sorry. He doesn't say it to me... I will never forgive." "He took my husband life he took my children father... why should I forgive him?... I will never forgive him." "All I am asking for is justice nothing more, nothing less," she said.
