Like the Wendy Williams Show, Shepherd’s new programme called Sherri will be distributed by Lionsgate’s Debmar-Mercury. Some of the cancelled show’s staff will move to the Sherri Show when it premieres later this year. Sherri is a natural choice to take over the slot. She has years of hosting experience from The View and Fox's Dish Nation.
