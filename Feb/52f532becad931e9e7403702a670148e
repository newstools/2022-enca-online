Mikaela Shiffrin bombed out of the giant slalom in Beijing. AFP/François-Xavier Marit BEIJING - US star Mikaela Shiffrin will be keen to put the disappointment of skiing out of the giant slalom behind her and focus on nailing down a second Olympic slalom medal. The slalom will take place over two legs on the man-made Ice River course in Yanqing, north of Beijing, on totally artificial snow. Shiffrin will face stiff competition to top the podium in skiing's shortest event. AFP looks at five things to know ahead of the race. -Shiffrin's mission - Shiffrin's bid for a third Olympic gold at a third Games ran aground in unfamiliar fashion in the giant slalom on Monday with a rare DNF (did not finish). The American, who won slalom gold in 2014 and giant slalom in 2018, slid unceremoniously out of the first leg after just four gates. Vowing not to shed any tears because it was a "waste of energy", Shiffrin added: "My best chance for the next races is to move forward, to refocus." She is a four-time world champion in slalom.
