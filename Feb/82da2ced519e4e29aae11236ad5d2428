City Power says the outage occurred just after 6pm when a line between substations was lost. It suspects lightning was involved. Suburbs affected include Gresswold, Alexandra, Observatory and Modderfontein. At least six substations have been affected and technicians are out investigating. #OutageUpdate #CityPowerUpdate #JoburgServices
