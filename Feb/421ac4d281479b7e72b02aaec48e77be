Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former Constitutional Court Justice, Johann Kriegler is slamming the Chief Justice interview process. He says Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo's session was a disgrace. READ: Civic group not happy with Malema, Mpofu taking part in Chief Justice interviews The Freedom Under Law chair says EFF leader, Julius Malema, and Advocate Dali Mpofu should not be on the panel. Friday is the fourth and final day of interviews in search of a new Chief Justice. Kriegler said, “I was watching both the women cricketers and the JSC yesterday [Thursday], the one was an inspiring picture, the other was depressing picture of a JSC still not fulfilling proper function under the constitution." "To see members trying to trap a candidate with smear tactics was extremely disappointing. We, in Freedom Under Law, had felt that Malema and Mpofu should not participate was completely correct, the manner in which the commission dealt with judge Mlambo was really a disgrace."
