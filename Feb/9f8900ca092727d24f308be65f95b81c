Swiss skier Beat Feuz won the men's downhill, one of the highlights of the Winter Olympics. AFP/Joe Klamar BEIJING - Switzerland's Beat Feuz scorched to gold in the men's Olympic downhill on Monday in a dramatic race that pitted skiers against an unforgiving course that was untested before the Games. The Swiss racer clocked 1min 42.69sec, finishing 0.10sec ahead of 41-year-old Frenchman Johan Clarey, while Austrian Matthias Mayer claimed a third Olympic medal in three Games with bronze. An elated Feuz whooped in the finish area after he saw the green light signifying he had taken the lead. He flicked one ski high in the air and sent it twirling skywards, to the delight of a crowd of a few hundred people made up mainly of volunteers and team members. Pre-race favourite Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway was pushed out of the medals, finishing fifth. Feuz, who won downhill bronze in the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, and 2014 champion Mayer became just the eighth and ninth skiers to win multiple Olympic medals in the downhill. Cascading down the testing "Rock" piste with a vertical drop of 890 metres, skiers quickly reached motorway-cruising speeds of 140km/h. They soared in excess of 40 metres off some of the five jumps that punctuate a rolling man-made course offering stunning cloudless views. A rip-roaring, snaky upper section that left racers in no doubt about what awaited them. Arms and poles flailed as skiers tried desperately to maintain equilibrium.
