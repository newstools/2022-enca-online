The Forum says if most of Dudula's concerns had any basis, it would approach the relevant stakeholders. It's commended law enforcement agencies for how they dealt with the organisation during its Hillbrow operation. READ: Operation Dudula takes to the streets of Hillbrow Operation Dudula is attempting to release the suburb from the clutches of crime. The group claims most criminal activity is committed by undocumented foreign nationals, many of whom reside in the suburb. This as tensions continue to simmer over undocumented foreign nationals in South Africa. Stun grenades, rubber bullets, teargas and water cannons greeted Operation Dudula members as police attempted to disperse them. They marched in the streets of Hillbrow, aiming to clean up the suburb which has become synonymous with crime and housing undocumented foreigners. eNCA’s senior journalist Aviwe Mtila filed this report.
