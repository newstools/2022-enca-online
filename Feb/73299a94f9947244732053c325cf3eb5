USA's Nathan Chen takes part in a training session at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing. AFP/Anne-Christine Poujoulat BEIJING - Strongly fancied Nathan Chen laid old demons to rest with a blistering start to his Olympics campaign in Beijing on Friday as the figure skating competition kicked off. The American scored a personal best to beat Japan's Shoma Uno into second place in the men's single short programme of the teams event. The score of 111.71 was just 0.11 points off the highest score ever for a short programme -- which is held by Uno's compatriot Yuzuru Hanyu, Chen's main rival in the individual event. Chen, who had a disastrous short programme at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics that dashed his hopes of gold, was asked Friday if he had now banished those bitter memories. "You learn the most from your mistakes," the 22-year-old said. "I don't think I'd be able to be here where I am now without having had that experience... rather than that being a demon I think that was a very helpful learning experience." - 'Genuinely happy' - Shoma Uno could not overhaul Nathan Chen despite a personal best score in the team competition The 2018 singles silver medallist Uno, wearing a flaming red shirt, scored 105.46 for his controlled performance to an oboe concerto, also a personal best. But it was not enough to beat Chen, who was magnetic as he waltzed across the ice to Charles Aznavour's "La Boheme". Russia's European champion, Mark Kondratiuk, was third. Chen is not getting too carried away yet. "I might not be the most emotive person, but deep down I'm genuinely happy," he added hastily. The men's individual event will start on February 8.
