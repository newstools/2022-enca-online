Sidelined again - England centre Manu Tuilagi has been ruled out of the side to face Wales with a hamstring injury. AFP/Glyn Kirk LONDON - England remain hopeful that Manu Tuilagi could yet feature in this season's Six Nations after the centre's latest setback in an injury-blighted career ruled him out of Saturday's match against Wales. Just hours after England coach Eddie Jones announced Thursday he was recalling Tuilagi to his starting XV, the Sale star suffered a strain to the same hamstring he tore in a victory over world champions South Africa in November. Jones now intends to name his revised team on Saturday. Tuilagi has not been ruled out of England's matches in the final two rounds, against Ireland and France. But given the 30-year-old's injury history -- he has missed 79 Tests since his England debut in 2011 -- few would be surprised if he endured another extended spell on the sidelines. "Manu had a slight hamstring strain at training on Thursday, so he's left camp and is at home," said England forwards coach Richard Cockerill on Friday. "It's not too serious as far as we know and hopefully he'll be back soon. Manu is in pretty good spirits. Unfortunately this is part of professional sport. "Manu's still got a smile on his face and is optimistic that he'll be back playing for club and country pretty soon. "On that front it's pretty positive but obviously we're disappointed for him personally, and it's disappointing for the team as he'd have been an important part of the squad."
