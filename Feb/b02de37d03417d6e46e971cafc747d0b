Britain's Emma Raducanu suffered another disappointing result retiring with a hip injury when a break down in the third set of her first-round match with Australia's Daria Saville in the Guadalajara Open. AFP/Brandon Malone GUADALAJARA - Emma Raducanu's disappointing run since her shock US Open triumph continued at the Guadalajara Open when the top seed retired with a hip injury in her first-round match against Australia's Daria Saville. Raducanu had won the first set 7-5 and served for the match at 5-3 but the 610th ranked Saville broke her and went on to level the match in a tie-break 7-6 (7/4). Raducanu called it a day when a break down at 3-4 in the deciding set after 3 hours and 36 minutes -- the longest match so far on the WTA Tour this year. Their tussle edged the 3 hours and 9 minutes which Montenegro's Danka Kovinic took to beat Jang Su-Jeong 6-3 2-6 6-4 in the first round of the Australian Open. Raducanu's latest setback follows her three-set second-round loss in the Australian Open to the 98th ranked Kovinic, when  the Briton hindered by a blister on her right hand. "This is probably the first match in a long time when I felt like I was being myself," said Saville, who was ranked as high as 20 before an Achilles tendon injury halted her progress. "I was being feisty Dasha. I just want to keep on working and keep on going here." Raducanu -- who was playing her first match since the Australian Open -- has failed to build on her extraordinary triumph at Flushing Meadow last September. In her five tournaments up to this week's Guadalajara Open her best run was into the quarter-finals of the Transylvanian Open last October. On Wednesday, it emerged that a London court had issued a restraining order against a man convicted of stalking Raducanu.
