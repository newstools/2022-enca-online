Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe has told coal miners that they should actively participate in the debate around the energy transition. Govan Whittles reports. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe has called on coal producers to defend their industry, which he says is under siege. Mantashe has told a gathering of coal miners that coal production will remain with South Africa beyond 2030 – and now is not the time to scale down. This comes as he is facing increasing pressure from environmental activists. But Mantashe won’t budge, insisting that abandoning coal production would be sabotaging South Africa’s economy. * eNCA's Govan Whittles reports.
