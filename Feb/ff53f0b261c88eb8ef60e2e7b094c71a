Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - EFF leader Julius Malema is sticking to his guns that the song 'Shoot the Boer' doesn't incite hate speech. Malema again took the stand at the Equality Court over the song earlier. READ: Malema says AfriForum lawsuit a 'waste of the court's time' It was a tense day in court as Malema and AfriForum's lawyer went head to head. Malema said the lobby group is "shortsighted" to call the song an EFF song and that's because it's been in existence way before the party was formed. READ: Malema: AfriForum's Roets not an expert on the EFF "The EFF cannot expropriate this song without compensation, it belongs to the struggle, it's a struggle song," Malema said. Malema addressed his followers outside court, saying the song shouldn't be taken literally. He says people sang this song because they were angry.
