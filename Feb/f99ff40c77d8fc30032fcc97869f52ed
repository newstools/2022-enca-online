AFP/Geoff Caddick LONDON - Wales centre Uilisi Halaholo has suffered a laceration to an eyelid ahead of next week's Six Nations clash with England and will not be released to play regional rugby, it was announced. Halaholo sustained the injury in training and will now remain in camp with Wayne Pivac's squad instead of going back to Cardiff this weekend as planned. "Following a laceration to the eyelid sustained in training on Tuesday, Uilisi Halaholo will remain with the Wales squad this week for monitoring rather than being released to Cardiff Rugby," the Welsh Rugby Union said in a statement. The New Zealand-born player, 31, was due to have been one of six Wales players released from camp this weekend to get minutes under their belt ahead of the England game on February 26. Cardiff pair Rhys Carre and James Ratti are available for Friday's United Rugby Championship home game with Zebre. Ospreys outside-half Gareth Anscombe, Scarlets scrum-half Kieran Hardy and Ulster hooker Bradley Roberts will also rejoin the Wales squad after weekend games. Wales bounced back from a heavy opening Six Nations defeat to Ireland to beat Scotland 20-17 in Cardiff last week.
