Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - 2016 Rio Olympics silver medallist Sunette Viljoen’s switch from athletics to cricket is already proving a hit. Viljoen was handy with the bat on her Titans Ladies debut last month, posting 160 runs off just 123 balls against Easterns. The two-time Commonwealth Games javelin champion has returned to a sport that saw her play for the Proteas at the age of just 17. "The athletics has taught me so many things on the mental side," she said. "Bringing that to the cricket, I think I have a lot to offer for my team to learn, how body takes to compete at the highest level and to rub off on them I think I have a lot of energy that I bring to the team which is very good."
