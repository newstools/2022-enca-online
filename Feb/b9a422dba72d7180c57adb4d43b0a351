Daft Punk, shown here performing at Coachella in 2006, shocked fans in 2021 by announcing their split NEW YORK - Exactly one year after French duo Daft Punk shocked fans by announcing an unceremonious split, they've returned to social media and are hosting a one-day-only livestream of a 1997 show on Twitch. The era-defining dancefloor act began the livestream at 2:22 Pacific time -- and on 02-22-22 no less -- sharing rare footage from their December 12, 1997 show in Los Angeles when they played the set without their iconic helmets. Daft Punk also released a deluxe anniversary edition of their debut album "Homework," which came out 25 years ago. From "Da Funk" in 1995 to "Get Lucky" in 2013, Daft Punk became the torch-bearers for French house music across the globe, winning six Grammy awards and pioneering the monumental sound-and-light shows that came to characterise the electronic dance movement (EDM) of recent years. They did so while almost never revealing their faces: the ubiquitous helmets became another much-copied trope of EDM stars but also afforded Thomas Bangalter, 47, and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, 48, freedom from the fame that quickly encircled them. Their fourth and last album, 2013's "Random Access Memories", was a phenomenal success, winning them four Grammys the following year including the best record for "Get Lucky", the million-selling lead single featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers.
