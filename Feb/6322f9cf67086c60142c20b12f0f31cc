READ: Mbalula: At least four months to clear driver's licence backlog The card-making machine that broke down last year and had to be sent to Germany for repairs is back in the country. Mbalula says he expects the backlog to be cleared soon. READ: Mbalula confirms licensing card machine repaired "I demonstrated to you the machine how it works, it's not a photocopy machine, it's very big. That machine was opened in 1998 by Mac Maharaj and we have started the process of getting into, we are probably among the last 13 countries that still have that machine," the minister said. "The problem with that machine was not major. It does have breakdowns but this was blown out of proportion. It has been fixed we are working very hard to do away with backlog. We are producing 400,000 cards per month. "We think by April we would have been done with a backlog of around two million people it will take us somewhere. It's not on our agenda to extend [the grace period] hence my call to all people, go and renew your driver's license, and be on the queue to renew your driver's license card. There will never be another window."
