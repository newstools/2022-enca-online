Minister of Home Affairs Aaron Motsoaledi spoke with eNCA about the 2022 budget speech. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says he's ecstatic about the funds allocated for infrastructure development. They will be used to implement major advanced technology at home affairs branches to improve efficiency. Border posts like Beitbridge in Musina will also see their infrastructure developed. WATCH: Aaron Motsoaledi talks Beitbridge border congestion "It's a gateway through the whole of Africa but when you arrive there you'll think it's a small roadblock, small gates, that is going to expand the area there to make it easier for trade, especially the trucking sector etc," Motsoaledi said. "The massive infrastructure is going to include modern technology. For instance, if you got to Beitbridge you're going to struggle to know what's in the truck, with modern tech any truck will have not x-ray. "That's outdated, but more sophisticated tech to see inside whether it's cash, liquor etc. whether something is being smuggled and all that... it will make it impossible for people who get bribed... it's also facilitated by that we have poor infrastructure and makes it easy for people to get bribed and do corruption."
