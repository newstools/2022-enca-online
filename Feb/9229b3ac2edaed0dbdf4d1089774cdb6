The Southeast Asian nation of 97 million people largely closed itself in March 2020 -- a move that clobbered its burgeoning tourism sector which was worth $32-billion a year before Covid. Authorities said in a statement they would begin issuing visas and accepting foreign arrivals from the middle of next month. The announcement comes a day after the communist country lifted all restrictions on international flights.
