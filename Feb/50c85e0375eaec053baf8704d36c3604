The facility has poor security and people come and go as they please. WATCH: Discussion | Joburg hijacked buildings on sale Johannesburg's MMC for housing, Mlungisi Mabaso, says people living illegally in such retirement homes should vacate immediately, or face legal action. In some cases, children and grandchildren are also living in these facilities and they inherit the units when the senior citizens pass on. Mabaso said, "what we have come across is that people who stay there have homes. They are staying there because they saw an opportunity and grabbed it….we had no security and the City couldn’t manage it properly and some saw an opportunity to illegally occupy…when we conducted an oversight  visit we realised there is a need for intervention after receiving numerous complaints from citizens." "In one old age home in Eldorado park we found that there’s a lot of young people staying there selling drugs and alcohol, easy movement because there’s no security…we are now reinforcing to manage people coming in out….they say they decided to occupy the facilities because their grannies died and they saw an opportunity to stay there…they grabbed an opportunity when they saw that we do not have tight security in the space."
