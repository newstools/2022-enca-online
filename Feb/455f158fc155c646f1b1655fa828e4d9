 JOHANNESBURG - The community of Orange Farm is pleading with the government to help close man-made holes in the area. They say they’ve made numerous requests to their previous local councillors. On Saturday, a five-year-old boy who fell into a manhole is being buried. Sadly it's not the first time such a tragedy has occurred in Orange Farm.
