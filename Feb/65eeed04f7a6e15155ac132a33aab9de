The Nike Air Force 1s were auctioned at Sotheby's in New York. AFP/Ed Jones NEW YORK - Sotheby's announced that an auction of 200 pairs of the Louis Vuitton and Nike "Air Force 1" sneaker created by late US designer Virgil Abloh had fetched a total of $25-million. Abloh, a multi-talented DJ, architect and designer died in November at the age of 41 following a private battle with cancer. A spokesman for the auction house told AFP that the most paid for one of the pairs was more than $350,000 during the online sale. The sums greatly exceed the initial estimates of Sotheby's, which had started the bidding at $2,000 and had predicted they would sell for between $5,000 and $15,000 a pair. In the end, the sneakers, which ranged in size from five to 18, averaged more than $100,000 per shoe. The cheapest sold for just over $75,000. The special edition sneaker, made of calf leather, was originally created for Louis Vuitton's spring-summer men's collection for 2022, of which Abloh was artistic director. The auction, held exclusively online, began just six days after the presentation of Abloh's last Vuitton collection in Paris in front of an emotional audience that included stars Rihanna, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams. "From the moment our auction launched, the energy has been electric," said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby's head of streetwear and modern collectables, adding that the event "broke the record for the most bids in the opening day of any online sale." The market for rare sports shoes is soaring, with sneakers having transformed into major collector's items that have recently been snatched up for tens of thousands of dollars.
