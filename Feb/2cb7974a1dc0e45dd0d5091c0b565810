There are calls for individuals implicated in corruption and state capture to be held accountable. Part two of the Zondo report into state capture has been released. It recommends investigations of the members and directors who sat on the Denel board. The report also put considerable focus on Transnet, and the relationship between the Guptas and former Minister Malusi Gigaba. Senior reporter Aviwe Mtila has been studying the report. Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - Law enforcement agencies must investigate -- and possibly prosecute -- several high profile people with links to the controversial Gupta family. The State Capture Commission has recommended this in part two of its report. It was handed to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office on Tuesday. READ: State capture report | Calls for prosecutions The Zondo report found that former Transnet CEO Brian Molefe and former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba are among the people that may have received cash payments during their visits to the Gupta compound between 2010 and 2018. The report also identified Transnet as the primary site of State Capture in financial terms. Contracts valued at over R41-billion were irregularly awarded to entities linked to the Gupta family. READ: State Capture Report | Presidency receives part two The Presidency has committed to sharing the contents of the report. This is the second of three volumes. The first volume was released at the start of January, and the third is expected later this month. Ramaphosa will submit the full report to Parliament by the end of June.
