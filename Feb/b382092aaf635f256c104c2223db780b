Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed pushed the start on the multi-billion dollar project at the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River. The dam is expected to more than double the country's current electricity supply. However, the project has caused a dispute between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia's neighbours say it could threaten their access to the Nile. But Ahmed says the water will continue to flow to Egypt and Sudan while generating electricity.
