Speaker of the National Assembley Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula JOHANNESBURG -  The National Assembly speaker has declined the African Transformation Movement's request for a secret ballot in the motion of no confidence against President Cyril Ramphosa. In a letter to the party, Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula says she doesn't believe a secret ballot would serve the interests of democracy. WATCH: Discussion | ATM requesting Ramaphosa vote of no confidence The ATM submitted the motion in December, citing gross incompetence and a dismal economic outlook. This is the second time the party's request for a secret vote has been denied. Last year, the Supreme Court of Appeal set aside a decision by the previous speaker, Thandi Modise, to reject a similar request.
