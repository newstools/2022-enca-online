President Pedro Castillo and his traditional wide-brimmed hat. AFP/Janine Costa LIMA - Has Peruvian President Pedro Castillo eaten his hat? That is what all Lima is asking this week after the president's trademark white "bambamarquino" suddenly went missing. Castillo and his traditional wide-brimmed hat have been inseparable during his rapid rise from rural schoolteacher to head of state. The first indigenous peasant ever to become president apparently only ever takes it off when he goes into church. But forced into a fourth cabinet reshuffle in just six months and with his approval ratings plummeting, Castillo has taken radical action and the hat has gone. "I suspect that an image coach advised him that he had to change and should start with the hat," political analyst Augusto Alvarez Rodrich told AFP. "The problem is that he has taken off the hat but not the ideas that were beneath it." The hat was a prominent feature on the campaign trail, although it turned Castillo into the butt of jokes by his opponents and some sections of the press.
