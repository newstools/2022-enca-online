File: Vodacom logo. JOHANNESBURG - Vodacom has been ordered by the High Court to recalculate and hike the amount it offered to “please call me” inventor Nkosana Makate. The court found he was shortchanged by Vodacom and it said the mobile giant must recalculate a suitable amount, higher than the R47-million it offered him.

Judge Hughes determined that Makate is entitled to be paid 5% of the total voice revenue generated from the product - starting from March 2001 until March 2021 - and not only for five years, as earlier calculated by Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub. Vodacom says it will appeal the ruling.
