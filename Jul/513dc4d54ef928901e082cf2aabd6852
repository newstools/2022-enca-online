In a largely unchanged Top 10, American Jessica Pegula moved up one place to a career-high seven. Croat Petra Martic jumped 30 spots to 55 after winning her second title in Lausanne on Sunday with American Bernarda Pera moving up 49 places to break into the Top 100 at 81st after her first title win in Budapest. Meanwhile, Argentine Francisco Cerundolo and American Maxime Cressy moved up the latest ATP rankings after winning their first titles at the weekend. Cerundolo, who broke into the Top 100 in February, now moves up nine places to a career-high 30 after winning in Bastad, Sweden. France-born Cressy jumps eight places to 33rd after winning in Newport on Sunday. The leaders remain unchanged with Russian Daniil Medvedev on top ahead of Germany's Alexander Zverev and Spaniard Rafael Nadal.
