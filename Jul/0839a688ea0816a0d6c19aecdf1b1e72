READ: Ramaphosa is open to any investigation: Kodwa This follows a request by DA leader John Steenhuisen. He wrote to National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, requesting that she establish a committee during the adjournment of the Assembly for a period of more than 14 days. This has been declined, with the speaker arguing that Rule 253 sets out requirements for the establishment of an Ad hoc Committee and one of them is the performance of a specific task. The President has been in the spotlight following the theft at his farm in 2020.
