READ: Eskom wins tariff battle against Nersa It’s been reported that Eskom will submit a new plan for cost-reflective tariffs which could see solar PV users pay more for Eskom services. But Yelland says this is not the case. He says Eskom is working on having a fixed component in the tariffs. READ: Eskom proposes users pay extra for solar energy "There is no levy of R900, the media has it all wrong. There is planned to be fixed component of the tariff. So the idea is proposed by Eskom to have a fixed capacity charge and a variable energy charge," Yelland said. "There's nothing wrong with that. The fixed component is not targeting Solar PV customers, it will be applied whether you have solar or not. "Even if you have no renewable energy you will still pay this fixed cost. There's nothing new about this. I have a fixed bill whether I have any electricity or not."
