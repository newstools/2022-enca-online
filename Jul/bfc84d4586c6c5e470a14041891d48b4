Number 1, I hustle to make things work so you need electricity, you need WIFI to make whatever works so without the electricity it’s just very frustrating and I’m not passionate." "I’m actually very angry and there’s nothing I can do and the mayor is not doing anything about it she was very disrespectful and we just have to accept it." Another said, "it’s definitely not working and it's definitely lip service. We have been hearing the same thing since 1994, we have been hearing the same issue that it is the budget, it's no longer acceptable when our children and the elderly are affected and there’s no point of recourse." "We as the youth need to step in to rectify things and this is were we got to now so it is a make or break situation."
