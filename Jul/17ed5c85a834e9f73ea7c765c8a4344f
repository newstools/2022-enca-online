Mick Schumacher on his way to a best ever sixth in F1 VIENNA - Winner Charles Leclerc was not the only driver celebrating after Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix as Mick Schumacher posted a best ever sixth place. The son of Michael Schumacher, the last Ferrari driver to win at the Red Bull Ring back in 2003, is on a roll after picking up his first Formula One points at Silverstone last weekend. His Haas team had two drivers in the points for a second successive race as Kevin Magnussen filled eighth. Schumacher had gone 30 races with no reward. He crossed the line in sixth after a couple of eye-catching overtaking moves, including, at one stage, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. "As athletes you're always after that pressure and with Silverstone, coming in with the points was what I needed to set off fireworks like this," he told Sky Sports. "I think we are going in the right direction. We scored points at Silverstone and today and I think we could have scored points yesterday (in the sprint) which shows a steep upward trend." He reckons working alongside Magnussen has been beneficial. "Kevin had a very great start to the season and has shown me different tools and different ideas. I feel like we're feeding off each other."
