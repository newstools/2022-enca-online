He needs to do an audit," Kwinika said. "Some people have been tranfered out of their departments. People with serious experience and qualifications are not being used to do the right jobs. "With the new organisational design the police commissioner needs to put these people back so they can serve South Africans. People want to be protected and currently, the police service is flat on that."
