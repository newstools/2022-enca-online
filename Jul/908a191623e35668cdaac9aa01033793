This follows the news of methanol being found in the bodies of the 21 teenagers who died at the Enyobeni tavern in East London. The organisation's Lucky Ntimane says the illicit trade of alcohol is growing, particularly in rural areas.

Eastern Cape and the KZN mostly on top," Ntimane said. "The illicit trade of alcohol has now reached 10 percent of the illegal market. These people doing this are well resourced hence we are worried that the issue we are saw at Enyobeni might not be the last." Ntimane said the organisation is encouraged by authorities' willingness to work with the liquor industry to avoid another tavern tragedy.
