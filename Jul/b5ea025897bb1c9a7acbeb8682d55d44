Recalled for the second Test in Bloemfontein last weekend, he lasted only 17 minutes before being replaced by Josh Adams, who set up a dramatic 13-12 victory by scoring a late try. The WRU said no replacement will be flown to South Africa, with Adams set to be included when the team is named on Thursday. There are fitness doubts about captain and fly-half Dan Bigger, another victim of a second Test shoulder injury, and tight-head prop Dillon Lewis, who left the field with an issue and later had an arm in a sling, for Saturday's decider. Gareth Anscombe, whose 79th-minute touchline conversion won the Bloemfontein Test, would probably start if Biggar cannot play. Should Lewis be ruled out, Sam Wainwright, who made his Test debut off the bench last weekend, could make the starting line-up with uncapped 21-year-old Harri O'Connor the only other available tight-head.
