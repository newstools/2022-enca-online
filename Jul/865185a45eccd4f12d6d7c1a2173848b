Frank Spencer, spokesperson of the SA Photovoltaic Industry Association discussed this with eNCA's Gareth Edwards. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Reports that solar Photovoltaic owners will be penalised a R900 levy by Eskom are not true. The real picture is far better. Solar system users will in future be able to sell their additional electricity to Eskom according to the SA Photovoltaic Industry Association. The power utility is working on having a fixed component in the tariffs. The association says this is nothing new. READ: No R900 levy to be imposed on solar users, says energy expert SA Photovoltaic Industry Association's Frank Spencer said, "the wrong end of the stick has been grasped on this story. the tariffs coming from Eskom for solar installations will have almost the same fixed charges as if you didn't have solar system at all." "These already exist on Eskom residential tariffs. They might be going up faster than we expect, but solar PV owners are not being penalised at all." "What will happen is that the Eskom solar tariff will allow you to sell back to them, something that hasn't existed before . That's the key change. So consumers with solar will be able to export any additional electricity to Eskom and get paid for that." "They'll be paid same tariff that they'd be buying electricity from Eskom. so this move is quite fair because if you sell to Eskom, it's the same price you buy from them. It's very different to any other municipalities that currently allow you to sell to them, but the price you sell is very much lower than the price that you buy."
