This new model replaces the operating model that involves exchanging locomotives, with five crews from origin to destination, as this resulted in delays. The rail will be from Belfast in Mpumalanga province to Maputo Port in Mozambique.

The country has about 70 percent of the world's total chrome reserves. It's also the largest producer of chrome ore in the world.
