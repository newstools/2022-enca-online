Don Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump joined their father and former first lady Melania for their mother's funeral service at St. Vincent Ferrer Church on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The siblings and their partners and children looked on solemnly as Ivana Trump's casket was carried into the church for the service. Donald Trump and Melania entered by a side door, an AFP photographer saw, as the funeral took place under heightened security.

Ivanka Trump described her mother as a "trailblazer" during the Catholic service that was billed as a "celebration of life," the tabloid added. Ivana Trump, the first wife of the former US president, died of "blunt impact injuries" on Thursday, reportedly caused by a fall down the stairs at her home. She was a model who grew up under communist rule in the former Czechoslovakia before marrying Donald Trump, then a budding real estate developer, in 1977. Throughout the '80s, the Trumps were one of New York's highest-profile couples, their extravagant lifestyle exemplifying the flashy excesses of the decade.
