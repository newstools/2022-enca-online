The troubled power utility says the generation system has sufficiently recovered but it's warning the public that its system remains constrained and that power cuts may be implemented should the need arise.
Eskom has been struggling to keep lights on for several weeks, implementing different stages of blackouts, including stage 6 thus hampering economic growth.
The country's still waiting for President Cyril Ramaphosa's comprehensive plan to tackle the energy crisis.
