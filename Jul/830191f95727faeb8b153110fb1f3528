Three Lesotho nationals and a South African were gunned down over the weekend. Western Cape police are now offering a R100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the second suspect. Meanwhile, the first suspect is expected to return to court on Monday on four charges of premeditated murder and being in the country illegally.
