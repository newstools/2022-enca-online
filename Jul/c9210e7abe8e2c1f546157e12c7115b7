Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson closes his eyes as he leads a virtual press conference inside 10 Downing Street in central London. LONDON - Britain's Boris Johnson will "make a statement to the country" Thursday, a Downing Street spokesman said, following reports he will resign as Conservative leader, triggering a party contest to replace him as prime minister.
It follows more than 50 resignations since Tuesday by ministers of various ranks and their Tory MP aides, as Johnson's support dramatically dropped away following a slew of recent scandals.
