Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - After weeks of deadlocked negotiations, unions have now accepted Eskom's one-year 7 percent wage deal. This is expected to ease pressure on the power utility after protest action around the wage talks contributed to the return to Stage 6 blackouts. READ: Eskom deal a path back to normality, says energy expert Eskom said in a statement that the housing allowance will increase by R400 per month. "The overall effect of this agreement on the wage bill will be more than R1-billion over the period of the agreement," the statement read. "Following this agreement, the NUM, Numsa and Solidarity have urged their members to return to work immediately." #Eskom #MediaStatement
