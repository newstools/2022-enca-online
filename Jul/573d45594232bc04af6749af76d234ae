The Patriotic Alliance leader has been lauded on social media for his hands-on approach to service delivery. McKenzie famously gave up his salary, bodyguards and refused a state vehicle. McKenzie has promised to end blackouts in the area within nine months.
He says the municipality would like to turn the region into South Africa's energy hub through a variety of methods, including wind power.
