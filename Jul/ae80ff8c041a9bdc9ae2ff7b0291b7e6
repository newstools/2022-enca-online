File: New SuperSport United coach Gavin Hunt  PRETORIA - Veteran Premier Soccer League coach, Gavin Hunt, is back in South Africa’s top flight. Hunt rejoins SuperSport United after the club parted ways with coach Kaitano Tembo in April. He's making a return to Matsatsantsa almost 10 years after leaving the club to join Bidvest Wits in 2013. Hunt is the most successful coach in the history of SuperSport United. He delivered three league titles between 2008 and 2010, before winning his fourth league title with Wits. The 57-year-old has been without a job after his unsuccessful stint with Chippa United. This after his spell with Kaizer Chiefs came to a sudden end following the termination of his three-year contract at Naturena.
