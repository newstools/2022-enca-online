In past years we've seen massive growth in veganism as more people lean toward a healthy living lifestyle. We've also seen a lot of meat alternatives hitting the market, including plant-based meatballs and chicken burgers. JOHANNESBURG - Plant-based products are no longer allowed to use meat terms on their labels. The Meat Processors Association is welcoming the decision by the Agriculture Department. It says labels such as plant-based schnitzel or boerewors are misleading. The association says misleading customers is the meat of the problem.
