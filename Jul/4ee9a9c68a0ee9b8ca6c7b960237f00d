Mantashe says the establishment of ‘Eskom 2.0’ is there to relieve pressure on the power utility by bolstering energy capacity.

"It will help in establishing what we can call Eskom 2, it may be something else because it takes away pressure from Eskom and we develop energy capacity because if you talk to Eskom today, they have all the problems but there is nothing concrete on a build programme," he said.  Seven people have been arrested following a spate of shootings in Alexandra. Police Minister Bheki Cele says the arrests were made through a collaboration between community members and the police. #DStv403 pic.twitter.com/9fKjPyzUyz
