This after the cross-examination of former SARS executive Johann van Loggerenberg. Instead, she has asked to submit written responses. Her lawyer Dali Mpofu admitted on her behalf that she had been in possession of a classified intelligence report while she was investigating an alleged rogue unit within the revenue service. eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger shares more details in the video above.
