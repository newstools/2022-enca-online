The reopening of initiation schools two years after their halt during the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted thousands of youngsters and so far this year, only one death was reported. 680 initiation schools were approved, and just under 200 of those, were for girls. All the schools are expected to close by Sunday next week. eNCA’s Moloko Moloto shares more details in the video above.
