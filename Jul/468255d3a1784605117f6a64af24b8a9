eNCA's Morena Mothupi spoke to former Springbok player, Breyton Paulse. #DStv403 PRETORIA - The Springboks’ winter Test season gets underway this afternoon. The Boks will take on Wales in the first match of the three-match Test Series. A lot has been said in the build-up to this clash with the tourists’ coach Wayne Pivac talking up Jacques Nienaber’s men. Nienaber was also once again full of praise for Wales. This despite the recent struggles that saw them lose their last four games in a row.
