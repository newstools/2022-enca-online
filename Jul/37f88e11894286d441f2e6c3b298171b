#DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress NEC says small businesses and poor households should be subsided so they can consider alternative energy sources. The party is encouraging people to turn to renewable energy to help alleviate the electricity crisis. "What is required now is a programme, a practical programme that says these are the steps, these are the interventions. Some of those we are attributing to them in our very statement," said ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe. "We directed our government that as they deal and look into this situation, they must also come up with a package of incentives that they will be able to give to the general public to allow them to use alternatives." Meanwhile, the party says some members implicated in State Capture have already volunteered to appear before the Integrity Commission.
