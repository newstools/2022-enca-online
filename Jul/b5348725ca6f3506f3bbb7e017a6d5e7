The 79-year-old passed away at a clinic in Barcelona, Spain where he lived after an illness. Dos Santos came to power four years after Angola gained independence from Portugal. He was at the helm for four decades. His political journey spanned single-party Marxist rule in post-colonial years and a democratic system of government adopted in 2008. He voluntarily stepped down when his health began failing.  [BREAKING NEWS] Angola's former President José Eduardo dos Santos has died aged 79. #eNCA #DStv403 pic.twitter.com/SrLstupmyp
