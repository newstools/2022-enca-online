Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe gazetted proposals for public comment today.
The public has 30 days to comment before the next steps begin. This form of deregulation will allow fuel retailers across the country to determine their own prices within certain limits.
Different stakeholders have been calling on the government to deregulate the price of fuel after fuel prices skyrocketed to record highs.
Currently, the fuel levy has been reduced by 75 cents to alleviate the pressure on consumers at the petrol pumps.
