Canadian swimmer Mary-Sophie Harvey says there was 'a four to six hour window' in the Budapest celebrations which she cannot remember PARIS - The International Swimming Federation (FINA) said Friday it will open an investigation after Canadian swimmer Mary-Sophie Harvey claimed she was drugged without her knowledge at the end of the last World Championships. The 22-year-old Canadian said on her Instagram account on Wednesday that she was drugged on the last night of the competition, which took place in Budapest at the end of June. In a press release sent to AFP, FINA said it was "deeply concerned" about the "well-being" of the swimmer, adding that it was in contact with the Canadian Federation and the Hungarian organising committee. "In 2021, FINA adopted widespread measures aimed at safeguarding athletes and an independent investigation Officer will be assigned to investigate the matter further," said the federation. Harvey claims to have woken up "completely lost" the day after the last evening of the Worlds with "a dozen bruises" on her body, alongside the manager and the doctor of the Canadian team. She says she celebrated the end of the competition that night in a "reasonable" way and then cannot remember anything. "There is a four to six hour window where I can't recall a single thing," she wrote. "I've heard bits and pieces by people and I've experienced judgement too." The swimmer, who posted photos of her injuries, added that she felt "ashamed". She also suffered a rib sprain and a mild concussion. "I'm still scared to think about the unknowns of that night," she wrote. "They told me it happens more often (than) we think and that I was lucky in a way." At the Budapest Worlds, Harvey won a bronze medal with her teammates in the 4x200 metre relay.
