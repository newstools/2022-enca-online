File:AFP/Michael Ciaglo  JOHANNESBURG - Standard Bank has scrapped its mandatory vaccination policy with immediate effect. In an internal memo to employees, seen by eNCA, the bank says it took the decision following a review of its policy. It says it considered current regulatory developments, as well as the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. It’s confident with its decision because 95% of employees are vaccinated. The policy change means that it is no longer compulsory for employees to get vaccinated or to produce a negative PCR test when going into the office.
