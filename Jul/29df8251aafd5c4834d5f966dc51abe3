Sars employees who are part of unions Nehawu and the public servants association have embarked on a strike. They want a total increase in the region of 12 percent but the tax authority says it just cannot do it. eNCA speaks to Sars commissioner, Edward Kieswetter for more. Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - The country’s logistics sector says the strike by SARS employees is worsening delays at border posts. Unions representing workers say the wage offer from SARS amounts to a 1.3% increase. They are calling for their wages to be hiked by 7%, which SARS says it still can't afford.    The revenue service says customs offices remain open at the border posts, as there is additional support from other government agencies. The Trucking Association of South Africa says drivers are being heavily impacted by the delays while the costs are rising.
