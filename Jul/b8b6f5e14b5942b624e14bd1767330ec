Tour de France leader Tadej Pogacar and the peloton were held up by an environmental protest, a growing trend at sports events. AFP/Marco Bertorello PARIS - When French environmental campaigners "Dernier Renovation" briefly halted the Tour de France in the Alps on Tuesday, they hooked into a global audience with sport becoming an increasingly popular medium for viral stunts by protestors. Climate activists "Just stop Oil" garnered a great deal of publicity at the British Grand Prix Silverstone circuit in July while others have also glued themselves to artistic treasures from the likes of Vincent van Gough. But sports appears to reach more people and some estimates say the Tour de France, over the 21 stages, reaches up to 3.5 billion viewers across the 190 countries in which it is broadcast. Broadcasters cut away to a view of the Alps where holiday crowds were enjoying a sunny day out in 24 degrees Celsius temperatures for the 15 minutes or so that the Tour de France stage 10 was held up. But the protest has gone viral. Environmental campaigners adopt a simple message and an effective platform There is consensus in France that by fighting against the Tour de France, publicity can be attained -- but that it is so popular that movements risk damaging their reputations. Green politics is growing fast and the narrative of a concerned young woman wanting to watch the Tour with her grandfather, likely bridged a generation gap. The 23-year-old cyclist Fred Wright of the Bahrain Victorious team was part of the small escape group of riders that first encountered the clutch of youthful campaigners. "You know that almost straight away. They're protesting about a good thing," he said, before adding: "But it's not great when it's in front of the Tour de France." The 2018 Tour champion Geraint Thomas said he'd seen the protesters "getting dragged away" in reference to a farmers protest during his title-winning campaign. "At least we didn't get pepper-sprayed this time," he said.
