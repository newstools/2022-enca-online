The case dates back to the 2018 funeral service of struggle stalwart, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Malema and Ndlozi claim they were initially not allowed access to the Fourways Memorial Park and had to push Lieutenant Colonel Johannes Venter out of the way to gain entry. WATCH | Malema and Ndlozi's assault case back in court "They couldn’t do anything, they couldn’t make us concede on any point. If anything, they conceded…many times. The prosecutor conceded that we were correct," Malema said. "As we took the stand, the state’s case became weaker and weaker. We are more than confident that we’ll emerge victorious. We had a very solid team." Ndlozi insists Johannes Venter wasn't humiliated at the funeral.
