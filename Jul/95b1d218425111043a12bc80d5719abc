The world number 50 pulled out due to a back injury, the R&A said in a brief statement, adding that he would be replaced by Rikuya Hoshino of Japan. Hoshino took Rose's place in a group with Tommy Fleetwood and Italy's 2018 Open champion, Francesco Molinari, that went out at 8.14am. "On the fourth hole yesterday during my practice round, I made a swing with my driver and started to feel pain in my lower back," Rose posted on Twitter on Thursday. "I've been getting around-the-clock treatment but it just doesn't feel ready to compete in this prestigious championship." Rose won the US Open in 2013 and came tied second in the British Open at Carnoustie in 2018.
