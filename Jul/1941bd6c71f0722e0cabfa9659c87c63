South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk competes in the men's 400m heats during the World Athletics Championships at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. AFP/Jewel Samad EUGENE - World record holder Wayde van Niekerk has made a blistering return to the track after qualifying for his first major championship final since his 2017 injury. Van Niekerk has booked a spot in the men’s 400m final after qualifying second in heat three of the semi-finals. The South African appeared to have a comfortable lead heading into the final 100 metres. This is before Barbadian Jonathan Jones surged forward, running shoulder-to-shoulder with the Olympic Champion. However, it was America’s Champion Allison who nudged ahead to win the heat by 44.7s followed by Van Niekerk on 44.75s and Jones in third place. The South African will be hoping for a podium finish in Friday’s final.
