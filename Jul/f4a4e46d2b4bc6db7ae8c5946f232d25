Public health care facilities such as hospitals and clinics have not been immune. What is an inconvenience for many of us becomes a life and death situation in a hospital setting. Ramphelane Morewane, acting deputy director-general for Primary Healthcare at the Department of Health discussed this with eNCA's Sally Burdett. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Rolling blackouts are set to continue and public health care facilities such as hospitals and clinics have not been immune. On Monday, eNCA spoke to Dr. Adam Mohamed, Head of Internal Medicine at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg. He echoed the call for hospitals to be excluded from any power cut schedule. READ: Charlotte Maxeke Hospital | Time for excuses is over Acting Deputy Director-General for primary healthcare at the National Health Department, Ramphelane Morewane, weighed in on the matter. “It’s a desirable position that there could be a way of exempting health facilities. We’re dealing with matters of life and death but that would be a call to be made at a high level," he said. "Imagine what would happen if the power went off while someone is in [an] operating theatre. It’s a position that I would support. "We are receiving reports from that level and you can’t blame people for thinking that it would make sense to have facilities exempted from load-shedding."
