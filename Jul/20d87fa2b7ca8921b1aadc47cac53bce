Down and almost out: France's Alize Cornet on her way to defeat against Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic LONDON - Who said what at Wimbledon on Monday, the eighth day of the 2022 championships at the All England Club:  "We don't have a clear view of what is considered to be a perfect champion, and it's a long way to the final so let's see what happens." -- Wimbledon chief executive Sally Bolton on the controversial character of Nick Kyrgios.  "I need a large glass of wine tonight for sure." -- Kyrgios after beating Brandon Nakashima in five sets to reach the quarter-finals.  "I never compared myself with anyone. I just know that I have this gift. I'm tall and I play really fast. It's effortless, I would say." -- Elena Rybakina after making the quarter-finals for the first time at Wimbledon.  "100%. When we were hitting, he was smashing me. I think the whole world knows Nick's level. With his serve and with just the amount of power he can generate, I think he can beat anyone on any day, and especially on grass." -- Australia's Jason Kubler on compatriot Nick Kyrgios's chances of winning Wimbledon.  "My agent had to come to force me out of a pub at 4:00 am to play Nadal second round, on Centre Court, Wimbledon. I've come a long way, that's for sure." -- Kyrgios on his unorthodox preparations before facing Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2019.  "I know that she doesn't show much emotion while I'm playing, but I know she's dying inside. Probably crying now alone in the cafeteria." -- Quarter-finalist Ajla Tomlanjovic on her mother's habit of being a nervous spectator.
